# Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to a [open source project of the U.S. government](https://code.gov/)! If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

We encourage you to read this project's CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), its [LICENSE](LICENSE.md), and its [README](README.md).

## Policies

We want to ensure a welcoming environment for all of our projects. Our staff follow the [TTS Code of Conduct](https://18f.gsa.gov/code-of-conduct/) and all contributors should do the same.

We adhere to the [18F Open Source Policy](https://github.com/18f/open-source-policy). If you have any questions, just [shoot us an email](mailto:18f@gsa.gov).

## Publishing workflow

This site is published on the [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov/)
platform. Team members can [create
branches](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository)
with their suggestions and edits. Federalist will build a preview link for
every branch so that you can view your changes before they are approved/merged.

If you are an Owner of this site, you should be added as
a [collaborator](https://help.github.com/en/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)
to this GitHub repository. When submitting changes, please create a branch
instead of a fork. Federalist does not build preview links for forked
repositories.

All changes should be done in a [pull
request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) to the
`main` branch. Suggestions and edits from team members and the
public can be previewed on the preview site before going live.

To view your preview link, at the bottom of the pull request are status checks,
including one from Federalist with a "details" link to your preview. For more
information, see the [Federalist
documentation](https://federalist.18f.gov/documentation/previews/).

We enforce some additional status checks on the `main` branch
to minimize the chance of publishing a broken site. Any change should be
reviewed by at least one team member. If you get stuck, ask a team member for
help!
