The [Sustainable Development Goals](http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/) (SDGs) are a universal call to action to:

  * end poverty
  
  * protect the planet
  
  * improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere

The 17 Goals were adopted by all UN Member States in 2015, as part of the [2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld).

## Background

### United Nations Sustainable Development Goal Indicators

The United Nations General Assembly adopted the [2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development](https://social.desa.un.org/2030agenda-sdgs) in September 2015. A core element of this Agenda is the agreement by the U.S. and all UN members to achieve 17 Sustainable Development Goals and 169 associated targets. **As of June 2024, the UN Statistical Commission (UNSC) endorsed [231 unique indicators](https://social.desa.un.org/2030agenda-sdgs)** proposed by its Interagency and Expert Group on SDGs (IAEG-SDGs) to monitor and review global and country-level progress on the SDGs.

### U.S. Report for SDG Global Indicators

In 2016, the U.S., through the office of the Chief Statistician of the United States (OCSOTUS) in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), established the U.S. SDG National Reporting Platform in collaboration with the General Services Administration (GSA). The OCSOTUS drove this initiative because the majority of the national statistics used to assess progress toward achieving the SDGs are produced by the U.S. Federal statistical system. In July 2024, to revitalize the platform, which has been inactive since its inception, the OCSOTUS conducted a data call to collect updated national statistics for SDG indicators. The reporting of these updated U.S. national statistics for the SDGs is targeted to be accessible to the public in September 2024, with ongoing updates to be made as new data becomes available.

## Purpose of the U.S. SDG Data Platform

Most of the global SDG indicators require national statistics as their basis. In the U.S., the majority of these national statistics are produced by our Federal Statistical System.  Nonetheless, U.S. statistics, like all data contributing to global estimates, will be harmonized to allow for international comparisons.

The SDG indicators are of interest to a wide audience, spanning not only international organizations but also stakeholders in government, academia and civil society. Although many stakeholders may be interested in global trends in SDG statistics, other stakeholders--including the U.S. general public, may be most interested in U.S. national trends over time. Therefore, these users may want to access U.S. (unharmonized) statistics as produced by U.S. agencies. Reporting these indicators in a way that is accessible and transparent to various data users is essential. To manage this task efficiently, responsibly, and transparently, statistical/data science expertise was applied to develop an open source, scalable, interoperable, and sustainable solution. 

Accordingly, **the U.S. SDG data platform was built to accommodate contributions from multiple data providers** on a flow basis to ensure that reporting reflects high quality, official Federal statistics. The platform is also accessible to the general public to promote transparency and accountability.

## Who Contributes Platform Data?

### Which Data Sources are Eligible?

The U.S. government (USG) has a decentralized Federal Statistical System, comprising over 100 Federal statistical programs. These statistics are used to inform public and private decision-making. Given the importance the USG has placed on ensuring the quality of data and statistics on which policy decisions are based, the Office of the U.S. Chief Statistician, located in the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of the Management Budget, has the authority to coordinate the U.S. Federal Statistical System.

The U.S. Chief Statistician does this by issuing and overseeing Federal statistical standards and guidance to ensure the relevance, accuracy, objectivity, and confidentiality of Federal statistical products. (See [USG Statistical Policy Directive 1](https://www.statspolicy.gov/policies/))

### How are Data Providers Selected?

When the SDGs were first developed, the USG convened an interagency Expert Group on SDG Indicators. This group was comprised of policy experts as well as Federal statistical agency and program experts engaged in the production of Federal statistics relevant to the SDG indicators. 

The Expert Group identified Federal data providers for each indicator for which Federal data were available. For statistical indicators, data providers are generally staff from Federal statistical agencies. **For non-statistical indicators, data providers are generally staff from Federal policy agencies.**

Most recently, the U.S. updated the U.S. SDG data platform to reflect changes in the global SDG indicators and metadata and the overall functioning of the tool.  To prepare the update of the U.S. SDG data platform, the Office of the Chief Statistician of the United States (OCSOTUS) asked the [Interagency Council on Statistical Policy (ICSP)](https://www.statspolicy.gov/about/) member agencies to provide and affirm data provider contacts for this effort.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### How often will new data be added to this site?

We will add data as soon as it has been sourced and checked. This includes new data as well as updates to data we have already published. We will continue to collect data from existing sources where possible.

### How do I suggest new or different data sources?

If you have feedback on the data sources we have used or have suggestions for new data sources then please email us at <a href="mailto:{{site.email_contacts.questions}}">{{site.email_contacts.questions}}</a>.

### What are you doing to fill data gaps?

For some indicators, although we may have data at the national level, our existing data sources donâ€™t always allow us to disaggregate by all main groups.

This means we need to look for new data sources, link existing ones, or model data.

### Can other countries copy this website?

Yes. See the [Open SDG Quick Start guide](https://open-sdg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick-start/) for technical instructions on the quickest way to get a copy of the Open SDG platform up and running.
