## Setup

After you've confirmed the above requirements, all lifecycle operations can be run with NPM scripts (ex. `npm run build`)

| NPM Command | Description                     |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| build       | Build the site                  |
| setup       | Install ruby gems               |
| start       | Serve a local build             |
| test        | Check for broken internal links |
| qa          | Check for broken external links |

## Broken Links

We run a [weekly QA cron job](https://github.com/GSA/sdg-indicators-usa/actions/workflows/qa.yml) to test for broken links.

Any errors the QA job finds will be added to the [ðŸ“Œ Link Checker Report](https://github.com/GSA/sdg-indicators-usa/issues/1140).

False positives, or URLs you wish to ignore can be put in the `.lycheeignore` file. This supports regex matching as well.

This job can also be run locally. Install instructions here: https://lychee.cli.rs/installation/

Then run with args: `lychee --base=https://sdg.data.gov .`
