Since 2008, the last update, the World Bank used $1.25 as the global line using 2005 prices. The 2014 release of a new set of purchasing power parity conversion factors (PPPs) for 2011 has prompted a revision of the international poverty line. In order to preserve the integrity of the goalposts for international targets such as the Sustainable Development Goals (and the World Bank's twin goals), the new poverty line was chosen so as to preserve the real purchasing power of the earlier $1.25 line (in 2005 PPPs) in poor countries. Using the new 2011 PPPs, the new line equals $1.90 per person per day. The higher value of the line in US dollars reflects the fact that the new PPPs yield a relatively lower purchasing power of that currency vis-'-vis those of most poor countries. Because the line was designed to preserve real purchasing power in poor countries, the revisions lead to relatively small changes in global poverty incidence: from 14.5 percent in the old method to 14.2 percent in the new method for 2011. There are changes in the regional composition of poverty, but they are also relatively small.\n After a new round of internationally comparable prices were collected in 2005, the international poverty line was set based on 15 national poverty lines from some of the poorest countries in the world. These national poverty lines were converted to a common currency by using purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates, which are constructed to ensure that the same quantity of goods and services are priced equivalently across countries. The average of these 15 lines was $1.25 per person per day (in 2005 PPP terms), and this became the new international poverty line.\n In 2015, the poverty lines of those same 15 poorest countries from 2005 were used to determine the new global poverty line. The new global poverty line uses updated price data to paint a more accurate picture of the costs of basic food, clothing, and shelter needs around the world. As of October 2015, the new global line is set at $1.90 using 2011 prices. The estimates have been back-casted for previous years, in order to assess the trends in poverty reduction over the last 25 years.\n Note that the PPP is computed on the basis of price data from across the world, and the responsibility for determining a particular year's PPP rests with the International Comparison Program (ICP), an independent statistical program with a Global Office housed within the World Bank's Development Data Group. For the 2011 PPPs, prices were collected across 199 countries of the world.\n For detailed information on this new line please consult:\n http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/2015/10/25114899/global-count-extreme-poor- 2012-data-issues-methodology-initial-results \n For a short review see:\n http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/brief/global-poverty-line-faq \n From ESCAP:\n ESCAP proposes to monitor this indicator for persons with disabilities. The Asia-Pacific regional framework to implement the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities during the Asian and Pacific Decade of Persons with Disabilities, 2013-2022, the Incheon Strategy to 'Make the Right Real' for Persons with Disabilities in Asia and the Pacific, contains 10 disability inclusive development goals, 27 targets and 62 indicators to track progress in achieving goals and targets. Indicator 1.1 of the Strategy is 'Proportion of persons with disabilities living below the US$ 1.25 (PPP) per day international poverty line'. All ESCAP member States are requested to establish a baseline data on the Incheon Strategy indicators including 1.1, by 2017, and some have already started reviewing their existing statistical instruments (e.g. household income and expenditure survey) to generate this indicator. The Washing Group short set of disabilities questions is recommended to be included as a module in the survey. Monitoring this indicator by age group would be practically impossible given that the main source is household income or consumption survey. It would be more practical to monitor the indicator by urban/rural area, and by social or ethnic characteristics (e.g. disability status, as is the case of Incheon Strategy indicator 1.1).

Some of these rights will be held by individuals, some by groups, and others by political entities. This bundle of rights can be broken up, rearranged and passed on to others. The following is the typology:\n Secure tenure rights or tenure security\n Tenure security is the right of individuals and groups to effective protection by the state against evictions, i.e. under international law, ""the permanent or temporary removal against their will of individuals, families and/communities from the home and/or the land they occupy, without the provision of, and access to, appropriate form of legal or other protection"". Security of tenure can then be defined as ""an agreement between an individual or group about land and residential property, which is governed and regulated by a legal and administrative framework. A person or household can be said to have secure tenure when they are protected from involuntary removal from their land or residence by the state, except in exceptional circumstances, and then only by means of a known and agreed legal procedure, which must itself be objective, equally applicable, contestable and independent.""\n Perceived tenure security refers to an individual's experience of his/her tenure situation or their estimated probability that their land rights will not be lost as a result of eviction by the state, land owner or other authority, or because of other factors that may cause involuntary relocation or curtail their use of the land, such as threats of land conflicts.\n Characterizing tenure status is based on four sets of interrelated parameters:\n \t1. Primary tenure rights on land\n \t2. Land tenure (rights of occupants on the land)\n \t3. Occupancy status (of the dwelling unit)\n \t4. Type of development\n Legal tenure security refers to the legal status of tenure and its protection backed up by state authority. De facto tenure security is based on the actual control of property, regardless of the legal status in which it is held. It can best be defined by the elements that compose it or contribute to it, such as the length of time of occupation, its socially accepted legitimacy and the level and cohesion of community organization.\n UNFAO (2003) defines Communally held land is where rights to use resources are held by a community. It refers to situations where rights to use resources are held and controlled by a community. While these rights may include communal rights to pastures and forests, they may also include exclusive private rights to agricultural land and residential plots.\n Local Communities\n A group of individuals belonging to the same community residing within or in the same vicinity of a particular parcel, property or natural resource. The community members are co-owners that share exclusive rights and duties, and benefits contribute to the community development.\n Indigenous land rights\n Indigenous land rights are rights specific to a particular ethnic group, having evolved through interaction of culture and environment and overseen by authorities whose legitimacy is based on occupation and spiritual ties to the locality.\n Community land rights\n Community land rights are collective rights of land ownership, access or use held or exercised in common by members of a community. A community may be designated as a village-based or more geographically dispersed community, or a clan or a lineage.\n Collective rights\n A situation where holders of land rights are clearly defined as a group and have the right to exclude others from the enjoyment of those land rights. Collective ownership of a natural resource refers to a situation where the holders of rights to a given natural resource are clearly defined as a collective group, and where they have the right to exclude third parties from the enjoyment of those rights.\n Common property\n Common property refers to situations in which entitled beneficiaries hold specified rights in common to specific areas of land, land-based natural resources or other types of property.\n Property / private property\n Property signifies dominion or right of use, control and disposition, which one may lawfully exercise over things, objects or land.\n Property rights\n Property rights refer to ""a bundle of rights to use, control, and transfer assets, including land. These include the rights to occupy, enjoy and use; to restrict others from entry or use; to dispose, buy or inherit; to develop or improve; to cultivate; to sublet; to realize financial benefits; and to access services in association with land.\n Open access resources\n Resources ' including land ' to which everyone has unrestricted access and that are not considered to be the property of anyone.\n Ecosystem services:\n Ecosystem services are the benefits people obtain from ecosystems. These include provisioning, regulating, and cultural services that directly affect people and supporting services needed to maintain the other services.\n Natural resources:\n The term 'natural resources' refers to oil, minerals, forests, water, and fertile land that occur in nature and can be exploited for economic gain.","Percentage of women and men with secure tenure rights to individually or communally held land, property and natural resources.

It includes people who are presumed dead although there is no physical evidence. The data on number of deaths and number of missing are mutually exclusive.\n Affected people:\n People who are affected by a hazardous event.\n Comment:\n People can be affected directly or indirectly. Affected people may experience short-term or long-term consequences to their lives, livelihoods or health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets.\n Directly affected:\n People who have suffered injury, illness or other health effects; who were evacuated, displaced, relocated; or have suffered direct damage to their livelihoods, economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets.\n Indirectly affected:\n People who have suffered consequences, other than or in addition to direct effects, over time due to disruption or changes in economy, critical infrastructures, basic services, commerce, work or social, health and physiological consequences.\n In this indicator, given the difficulties in assessing the full range of all affected (directly and indirectly), UNISDR proposes the use of an indicator that would estimate ""directly affected"" as a proxy for the number of affected. This indicator, while not perfect, comes from data widely available and could be used consistently across countries and over time to measure the achievement of the Target B.\n From the perspective of data availability and measurability, it is proposed to build a composite indicator which consists of ""directly affected"", or those who are \n\tInjured or ill, \n\tEvacuated, \n\tRelocated \nand to measure the number who suffered direct damage to their livelihoods or assets, \n\tPeople whose houses were damaged or destroyed \n\tPeople who received food relief aid.\n Injured or ill:\n The number of people suffering from physical injuries, trauma or cases of disease requiring immediate medical assistance as a direct result of a hazardous event.\n Evacuated:\n The number of people who temporarily moved from where they were (including their place of residence, work places, schools and hospitals) to safer locations in order to ensure their safety.\n Relocated:\n The number of people who moved permanently from their homes to new sites due to hazardous event. Note: This definition excludes preventive relocation before the event.\n People whose houses were damaged or destroyed due to hazardous events:\n The estimated number of inhabitants previously living in the houses (housing units) damaged or destroyed. All the inhabitants of these houses (housing units) are assumed to be affected being in their dwelling or by direct consequence of the destruction/damage to their housings (housing units). An average number of inhabitants per house (housing unit) in the country can be used to estimate the value.\n Houses destroyed:\n Houses (housing units) levelled, buried, collapsed, washed away or damaged to the extent that they are no longer habitable.\n Houses damaged:\n Houses (housing units) with minor damage, not structural or architectural, which may continue to be habitable, although they may require some repair or cleaning.\n People who received food relief aid:\n The number of persons who received food /nutrition, by government or as humanitarian aid, during or in the aftermath of a hazardous event.\n Hazardous event:\n The occurrence of a natural or human-induced phenomenon in a particular place during a particular period of time due to the existence of a hazard.\n Hazard:\n A potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon or human activity that may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation.\n UNISDR recommends setting NO threshold for recording hazardous event in order to monitor all hazardous events. Small-scale but frequent hazardous events that are not registered in international disaster loss databases account for an important share of damages and losses when they are combined, and often go unnoticed by the national and international community. These events, when accumulated, are often a source of poverty in developing countries but can be effectively addressed by well-designed policies. The scope of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 is ""the risk of small-scale and large-scale, frequent and infrequent, sudden and slow-onset disasters, caused by natural or man-made hazards as well as relate environmental, technological and biological hazards and risks"".\n Regarding the inclusion of biological and environmental hazards in natural hazards category and whether and how to integrate man-made hazards, UNISDR will discuss the issue with WHO and other organizations (for example, WHO would be in a better position in terms of data, knowledge and relationship with Member States and other stakeholders to monitor biological events including epidemics. However, we generally do not expect biological disasters will cause physical damages to facilities.).\n Note: Terminology will be discussed and finalized in the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group for Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.","Summation of data on related indicators from national disaster loss databases. Make the sum a relative figure by using global population data (World Bank or UN Statistics information). Relativity is important because population growth (expected to be 9 billion in 2050) may translate into increased hazard exposure of population.\n The Expert Group recommends not using the indicators related with the people whose houses were damaged/destroyed in the computation. UNISDR and IRDR groups recommend using them as they can be estimated from widely available and verifiable data and reflect vulnerability and livelihood issues. Data on housing damage and destroyed is essential for economic loss, so using these indicators would not impose additional data collection burden.\n Double-counting: From practical perspective, double counting of affected people is unavoidable (for example, injured and relocated) in many countries. Minimum double counting is summing 'number of injured' and Number of people whose housings were damaged or destroyed. Relocated is sub-set of number of people whose housings were destroyed.\n The data can be disaggregated by hazard type. When applied to proposed target 13.1 and 15.3, hydrological, meteorological and climatological and indirectly biological disasters are monitored.","Cities around the world, as well as rural populations, witness growing disaster risks. Impacts of climate change on sustainable development are observed through both slow-onset events (e.g. sea level rise, increasing temperatures, ocean acidification, glacial retreat and related impacts, salinization, land and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity and desertification) and extreme weather events. Human loss can be measured by the number of deaths, missing, injured or ill, evacuated, relocated, people whose houses were damaged/destroyed and people who received food relief aid as a direct result of the hazardous events.\n Cities are some of the most vulnerable areas to natural disasters. Unplanned urban development (e.g. informal settlements, overcrowding, inadequate infrastructures) exacerbates urban vulnerability to climate change impacts and hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. Over half of all coastal areas are urbanized and 21 of the world's 33 mega cities lie in coastal flood zones. SIDS and coastal regions are particularly affected by sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion, and extreme events (e.g. tsunamis and storm surges) due to undermining natural protective barriers, low levels of development combined with rapid population growth in low lying coastal areas and inadequate capacity to adapt. Poor urban populations must often resort to unsustainable coping strategies and mechanisms. \nLarge numbers of people remain perilously close to falling into poverty, experiencing shocks that they are unable to cope with. For the poor, a shock of even a relatively short duration can have long term consequences. Several dimensions of poverty are closely related to environment, which is often affected by natural disasters. The poverty reduction agenda could include well-designed social protection scheme to help protecting the poor against sudden shocks and the development of capacities to better predict and prepare for such shocks. Better management of natural resources can themselves strengthen the resilience of the poor, by both reducing the likelihood of natural hazardous events and offering resources to help cope with them.\n Biodiversity provides ecosystem resilience and contributes to the ability to respond to unpredictable global changes and natural disasters. Healthy ecosystems act as buffers against natural hazards, providing valuable yet underutilized approaches for climate change adaptation, enhancing natural resilience and reducing the vulnerability of people, for example to floods and the effects of land degradation. These ecosystem services improve the sustainability and economic efficiency of built infrastructure, and are critical for sustainable and resilient urban areas.\n This indicator will track human-related loss. The disaster loss data (particularly mortality) are significantly influenced by large-scale catastrophic event, which represent important outliers. UNISDR recommends countries to report the data by event, so complementary analysis can be done by both including and excluding such catastrophic events.\n The indicator will build bridge between SDGs and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction because the reduction of human related loss is included in the Sendai Framework global targets and will also be monitored under the Sendai Framework Monitoring Mechanism.",,,,,,,"National disaster loss database, reported to UNISDR",,,"By country, by event, by hazard type (e.g. disaggregation by climatological, hydrological, meteorological, geophysical, biological and extra-terrestrial for natural hazards is possible following IRDR* classification), by death/missing/injured or ill/evacuated/relocated/people whose houses were damaged/people whose houses were destroyed/people who received food relief aid.\n*Integrated Research on Disaster Risk (2014), Peril Classification and Hazard Glossary (IRDR DATA Publication No.1), Beijing: Integrated Research on Disaster Risk.\n Additionally, the Expert Group recommended disaggregation by age, sex, location of residence and other characteristics (e.g. disability) as relevant and possible.

The monetary value of total or partial destruction of physical assets existing in the affected area. Examples include loss to physical assets such as damaged housings, factories and infrastructure. Direct losses usually happen during the event or within the first few hours after the event and are often assessed soon after the event to estimate recovery cost and claim insurance payments. These are tangible and relatively easy to measure. Direct Economic loss in this indicator framework consists of agriculture loss, damage to industrial and commercial facilities, damage to housings and critical infrastructures. \n\tWe limit the economic loss into direct economic loss, excluding indirect loss (e.g. loss due to interrupted production) and macro-economic loss. The reason is that there is not yet universally standardized methodology to measure indirect and macro-economic loss while direct loss data monitoring is relatively simpler and more standardized. \nGlobal gross domestic product: Summation of GDP of Countries. GDP definition according to the World Bank. \nHazardous event: The occurrence of a natural or human-induced phenomenon in a particular place during a particular period of time due to the existence of a hazard. \nHazard: A potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon or human activity that may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. \nUNISDR recommends setting NO threshold for recording hazardous event in order to monitor all hazardous events. Small-scale but frequent hazardous events that are not registered in international disaster loss databases account for an important share of damages and losses when they are combined, and often go unnoticed by the national and international community. These events, when accumulated, are often a source of poverty in developing countries but can be effectively addressed by well-designed policies. The scope of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 is ""the risk of small-scale and large-scale, frequent and infrequent, sudden and slow-onset disasters, caused by natural or man-made hazards as well as relate environmental, technological and biological hazards and risks"". \nRegarding the inclusion of biological and environmental hazards in natural hazards category and whether and how to integrate man-made hazards, UNISDR will discuss the issue with WHO and other organizations (for example, WHO would be in a better position in terms of data, knowledge and relationship with Member States and other stakeholders to monitor biological events including epidemics. However, we generally do not expect biological disasters will cause physical damages to facilities. ). \n\tNote: Terminology will be discussed and finalized in the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group for Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.","The original national disaster loss databases usually register physical damage value (housing unit loss, infrastructure loss etc.). Need conversion from physical value to monetary value according to the UNISDR methodology. After converted, divide global direct economic loss by global GDP (inflation adjusted, constant USD) calculated from World Bank Development Indicators.","Cities around the world, as well as rural populations, witness growing disaster risks. Impacts of climate change on sustainable development are observed through both slow-onset events (e.g. sea level rise, increasing temperatures, ocean acidification, glacial retreat and related impacts, salinization, land and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity and desertification) and extreme weather events. The economic loss indicator would track loss to agricultural, industrial and commercial sectors and damage to housing and critical infrastructure. \nCities are some of the most vulnerable areas to natural disasters. Unplanned urban development (e.g. informal settlements, overcrowding, inadequate infrastructures) exacerbates urban vulnerability to climate change impacts and hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. Over half of all coastal areas are urbanized and 21 of the world's 33 mega cities lie in coastal flood zones. SIDS and coastal regions are particularly affected by sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion, and extreme events (e.g. tsunamis and storm surges) due to undermining natural protective barriers, low levels of development combined with rapid population growth in low lying coastal areas and inadequate capacity to adapt. Poor urban populations must often resort to unsustainable coping strategies and mechanisms. \nLarge numbers of people remain perilously close to falling into poverty, experiencing shocks that they are unable to cope with. For the poor, a shock of even a relatively short duration can have long term consequences. Several dimensions of poverty are closely related to environment, which is often affected by natural disasters. The poverty reduction agenda could include well-designed social protection scheme to help protecting the poor against sudden shocks and the development of capacities to better predict and prepare for such shocks. Better management of natural resources can themselves strengthen the resilience of the poor, by both reducing the likelihood of natural hazardous events and offering resources to help cope with them. \nThe environment for food production is increasingly challenging, particularly for smallholders, due to environmental and climate-related factors. Similar to extreme income poverty, food insecurity continues to be predominantly concentrated in rural areas of developing countries, and disproportionately affects poor farmers, agricultural workers, pastoralists and rural communities. Common conditions for protracted crisis situations include frequent or continued exposure to shocks that undermine livelihoods, food and market systems. Special consideration needs to be given to population living in areas prone to environmental and natural disaster shocks. \nBiodiversity provides ecosystem resilience and contributes to the ability to respond to unpredictable global changes and natural disasters. Healthy ecosystems act as buffers against natural hazards, providing valuable yet underutilized approaches for climate change adaptation, enhancing natural resilience and reducing the vulnerability of people, for example to floods and the effects of land degradation. These ecosystem services improve the sustainability and economic efficiency of built infrastructure, and are critical for sustainable and resilient urban areas. \nThis indicator will track direct physical loss expressed in economic term. The disaster loss data (particularly mortality) are significantly influenced by large-scale catastrophic event, which represent important outliers. UNISDR recommends countries to report the data by event, so complementary analysis can be done by both including and excluding such catastrophic events.

It is written as: ______ = ' __(__)____ __<________ where f(x) is the probability density function of per capita calorie consumption and MDER is a Minimum Dietary Energy Requirement. The MDER threshold is computed on the basis of normative energy requirement standards referred to a minimum level of physical activity. Estimates of the number of undernourished (NoU) - calculated by multiplying the PoU by the size of the reference population - are used to monitor progress towards the World Food Summit goal of reducing by half the number of people suffering from undernourishment. The parameters needed for the calculation of the indicator are: the mean level of dietary energy consumption (DEC); a cut-off point defined as the Minimum Dietary Energy Requirement (MDER); the coefficient of variation (CV) as a parameter accounting for inequality in food consumption; and a skewedness (SK) parameter accounting for asymmetry in the distribution. The DEC as well as the MDER are updated annually, with the former calculated from the FAO Food Balance Sheets. The MDER is calculated as a weighted average of energy requirements according to sex and age class, and is updated each year from UN population ratio data. The inequality in food consumption parameters are derived from National Household Survey data when such data is available and reliable. Due to the limited number of available household surveys, the inequality in food access parameters are updated much less frequently over time than the DEC and MDER parameters.",,,,,"The indicator refers to food available for consumption over a period on one year. It refers to a severe condition of lack of food. In this respect, it is fully consistent with the spirit of the developmental goal. Energy intake is a very specific aspect of food insecurity, which applies where conditions are more severe.\n Ideally, undernourishment should be assessed at the individual level by comparing individual energy requirements with individual energy intakes. This would enable the classification of each person in the population as undernourished or not. However, this approach is not feasible for two reasons: individual energy requirements are practically unobservable with standard data collection methods; and individual food consumption is currently measured with precision in only a few countries and for relatively limited samples. The individual-level consumption data that can be estimated from National Household Survey data are largely approximated owing to disparities in intra-household food allocation, the variability of individual energy requirements, and the day-to-day variability of food consumption that can arise for reasons independent of food insecurity. The solution adopted by FAO has been to estimate the PoU with reference to the population as a whole, summarized through a representative individual, and to combine available micro-data on food consumption with macro-data.\n The Prevalence of Undernourishment indicator is still one of the most reliable tools to monitor progress towards reducing global hunger. Recent innovations to the methodology, such as those presented in Wanner et al. (2014) allow to improve the quality of global monitoring, and to capture more accurately progress in reducing hunger and how the problem is currently distributed globally. In 2012 the functional form of habitual food consumption was modified. The Skewed Normal functional form was introduced to take into account the asymmetry of the distribution. This was a major improvement, as it allowed better capturing the characteristics of the distribution, and how this would change when calories consumption increases. At the same time, a strong increase was promoted in the number of Household Budget Survey employed in the calculation of the CV and SK parameter. Household Budget Survey now cover about 70 percent of the total number of undernourished estimated. Another main recent refinement, introduced in 2014, is a data-driven flexible selection criterion for the choice of the functional form of the distribution of per capita habitual calorie consumption that maintains the probability framework. Further improvements to the calculation of inequality in food access parameters, both directly and indirectly, have been made in 2014 to allow for time-varying parameters that take into account economic progress and demographic changes.\n At the same time, the indicator does not convey information on the quality of food, nor on its nutritional value. The reason is that it focuses on the most severe aspect of hunger, and it is therefore solely based on the number of calories consumed through food. The parametric approach adopted by FAO allows obtaining reliable estimated for relatively large population groups.\n Information about the sufficiency of calories from food for specific population groups, such as the poor and the vulnerable, can be derived if such groups can be identified within the population, and if sampling allows drawing inference on the habitual food consumption of these groups.\n In principle, the indicator can be computed for specific population groups, such as the poor and the vulnerable. However, this requires that such groups are clearly identifiable in the population, and that sampling allows drawing inference on their habitual food consumption. In fact, such information is seldom available.","Yes, the indicator exists. FAO maintains the data and reports on it annually.\n Metadata are available at the FAO Statistics website http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-fs/essfadata/it/#.VM89cGjF-VM as Excel sheets associated with the data; and from the FAOSTAT website, at http://faostat3.fao.org/download/D/*/E.","Reliability\n Reliability depends on the quality of the background data, specifically on Dietary Energy Supply, the distribution of habitual food consumption in the population ' which is derived from household budget surveys whenever possible - - the population, its structure and height distribution. No statistical margin of error can be determined for the prevalence of undernourishment.\n The ability of the indicator to approximate access to food depends upon the extent to which existing data allow characterizing effectively the probability distribution of habitual food consumption in the reference population. As mentioned, the FAO methodology combines available micro-data on food consumption derived from surveys with macro-data from food balance sheets. Food balance sheets provide information on the amount of food that is available for consumption after taking into account all the possible alternative uses of the food items; hence, they provide approximate measures of per capita consumption, which are available for a large number of countries and are homogenous. The methodology adopted for computing these data is currently under revision, together with the estimates of waste parameters employed to derive the DEC, so the level of accuracy is expected to increase in the next few years. Survey data, where available and reliable, are employed in the FAO methodology to compute the variability (CV) and skewedness (SK) parameters that characterize the distribution of food consumption f(x). It is therefore essential that surveys are improved to obtain more accurate measures of undernourishment. Such improvement will require promoting greater standardization across existing surveys, particularly household budget surveys, and conducting more refined surveys that capture food intake at the individual level.\n Coverage\n Consistent time series for the indicator exist from 1990-92 for about 140 countries. The indicator is regularly reported in the annual State of Food Insecurity in the World Report published by FAO, IFAD and WFP since 1999 and in the Millennium Development Goal Report of the UN Statistics Division. Data on the indicators are published on the FAO Statistics website, at http://www.fao.org/economic/ess/ess-fs/ess-fadata/it/#.VM89cGjF-VM and updated every year. From year 2014 they are also available in FAOSTAT, at http://faostat3.fao.org/download/D/*/E.\n Comparability across countries\n Comparability across time and space is relatively strong. The only potential cause of lack of homogeneity is the quality of the background data. Not all countries monitored undertake regular and reliable surveys of food consumption. In countries where this information source is of poor quality or missing, the distribution of habitual food consumption is estimated indirectly, through an econometric exercise that relates the CV of food consumption to food prices, incomes and their distribution.\n Sub-national estimates\n In principle the indicator could be defined at sub-national level. However, reliable information has to be available on the amount and distribution of habitual food consumption in the population of the sub-national areas of interest. In fact, this information is frequently available only for wide population sub-groups ' such as rural and urban areas and some major geographical areas. The global monitoring exercise has therefore always relied only on the Prevalence of Undernourishment at national level, and never used the indicator at sub-national levels.","Yes. A target for 2030 can be identified in terms of a minimum level, allowing for the possibility that lack of food has become marginal in the reference population. The choice of the threshold should also reflect the ability of the indicator to be accurate at such level, and effectively capture changes in the level","FAO maintains the data and reports on it annually.

Key results from the analysis of the data collected by FAO in 2014 in 145 countries through the GWP confirm the reliability of the FIES based measure of the prevalence of food security at different levels of severity even after relatively minor efforts of adaptation of the questions to local languages. Items' performance has been tested through the infit statistics and only in one case only one of the items showed an infit value outside the range 0.7-1.3 that is considered appropriate to ensure sufficient reliability. This confirms the appropriateness of the items chosen (a result of decades of experience with development and application of experience-based food security scales in North and Latin America and throughout the world.)\n \t(b) Sample size: Samples of 1000 individuals, characteristic of the GWP, 2 have proven sufficient to ensure margins of errors lower than 2% for prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity, and lower than 1% for prevalence of severe food insecurity at national level. Larger sample sizes might further reduce these margins of error.\n Coverage\n By leveraging on the GWP as a data collection vehicle, FAO can ensure global coverage (about 150 countries every year covering more than 95% of the world population) annually, for national level assessments.\n Comparability across countries\n The Voices of the Hungry project has successfully developed and tested the methodology to scale individual measures to a single global reference standard and to make estimates of the prevalence of food insecurity comparable across countries. The method is possible due to the reference to Item Response Theory for measurement and it inspired by existing practice in equating educational and psycho-attitudinal tests.\n Possibility to compute the indicator at sub-national level\n The indicators can be computed at any level of disaggregation. Reliability of the measure is of course conditioned by the available sample size and representativeness of the specific sample. FAO suggests that, for meaningful disaggregation at subnational level, the data should be collected with surveys that are designed to be representative of the target population.","While SDG target 2.1 calls for an eradication of hunger, meaningful targets that would reflect bringing food insecurity to minimal ""physiological"" levels and the eradication of hunger could be offset for moderate and severe food insecurity and for developed countries and some transition economies.\n Credible, yet ambitious targets for other countries could be defined based on an analysis of the 2014 benchmark that will be available in the first quarter of 2015.","The indicators and the global reference standard necessary to ensure proper cross-country comparability of the measures are being developed and will be maintained by the FAO Statistics Division, 'Voices of the Hungry' team.'

An AOI less than 1 reflects a lower orientation to agriculture, while an AOI equal to 1 reflects neutrality in a government's orientation to the agriculture sector.\n Agriculture refers to the agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting sector, based on the Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG) developed by the OECD and published by the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD), found at http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl=4&Top=1&Lg=1.\n Government expenditures are all outlays or expenses associated with supporting a particular sector or purse, including compensation of employees, and subsidies and grants paid as transfers to individuals or corporations in that sector. For a full description, see the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001, developed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), found at http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/gfs/manual/.\n The Agriculture Share of GDP is measured by the ratio of Agriculture Value Added over GDP, based on official data reported by countries to the United Nations Statistics Division or to the OECD.\n The annual data and indicator, collected and compiled by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), can be found on the FAOSTAT domain at: http://faostat3.fao.org/download/I/IG/E, covering the periods 2001- 2012.",Agriculture Share of Government Expenditures divided by Agriculture Share of GDP = AOI,,,,"Government spending in Agriculture includes spending on sector policies and programs; soil improvement and soil degradation control; irrigation and reservoirs for agricultural use; animal health management, livestock research and training in animal husbandry; marine/freshwater biological research; afforestation and other forestry projects; etc.\n Spending in these agricultural activities helps to increase sector efficiency, productivity and income growth by increasing physical or human capital and /or reducing inter-temporal budget constraints. However, the private sector typically under-invests in these activities due to the presence of market failure (e.g. the public good nature of research and development; the positive externalities from improved soil and water conditions; lack of access to competitive credit due to asymmetric information between producers and financial institutions, etc.).\n Government spending in agriculture is essential to address these market failures. This leads to several potential indicators for the SDGs, which include: a) the level of Government Expenditures in Agriculture (GEA); b) the Agriculture share of Government Expenditures, and c) the AOI for Government Expenditures.\n An indicator that measures GEA levels fails to take into account the size of an economy. If two countries, A and B, have the same level of GEA, and the same agriculture contribution to GDP, but country A's economy is 10 times that of country B. Setting the same target levels for GEA fails to take economic size into account.\n An indicator that measures the Agriculture share of Government Expenditures fails to take into the relative contributions of the agricultural sector to a country's GDP. Consider two countries with the same economic size, C and D, where agriculture contributes 2% to C's GDP, and 10% to country D's GDP. If total Government Expenditures were equal in both countries, C would experience greater relative investment in Agriculture than D. If total Government Expenditures differed, the result could be magnified or diluted.\n The AOI index takes into account a country's economic size, Agriculture's contribution to GDP, and the total amount of Government Expenditures. As such, it allows for the setting of a universal and achievable target.","The indicator is maintained and reported by FAO in FAOSTAT, with metadata soon to be available at http://faostat3.fao.org/mes/methodology_list/E.\n The underlying annual data is official country data, from 2001 to 2012, reported by countries through a questionnaire jointly developed by FAO and the IMF using the COFOG and GFSM classifications. The database currently covers 139 countries","The use of the COFOG and GFSM classifications promotes international and inter-temporal comparisons. The expenditure data reported is typically based on administrative data based on a government's public accounts, while GDP and Agriculture Value Added is based on its National Accounts. The nature of the data typically prohibits indicators at sub-national level, as most countries do no compile sub-national GDP estimates, nor sub-national Government Expenditure figures.\n Reliability\nThe numerator (Agriculture Share of Government Expenditures) is based on administrative data, which has no statistical margin of error. The denominator (Agriculture share of GDP) is based on a System of National Accounts, following international guidelines, in which either Agriculture Value-Added or GDP estimates can suffer from statistical errors, though it is difficult to measure. Errors and lack of reliability due to from non-statistical errors can arise, for example, as a result of the mapping between national concepts to international classifications (by respondents), the use of different measures of government across countries due to reporting issues (budgetary central, central, and general, as described above).\n Coverage\n It is relatively high for these particular indicators, with 139 countries included. However, some countries have not provided data for all 13 years from 2001 to 2012, and the level of government to which expenditures pertain can differ.\n Comparability across countries\n It is facilitated by use of the Agriculture share of Government Expenditures in the numerator , which mitigates difference that arise when some countries report expenditures for all levels of government, and others only for the central government. This does not rule out the fact that state and local governments may spend a different share on Agriculture than the central government. For this reason, analysis of the trends in this indicator may be more reliable, for comparison purposes, than just the indicator alone.\n While COFOG and GFSM facilitate international comparisons, not all countries report expenditures covering all three levels of government (Central, State and Municipal). The three levels of reporting include (from smallest to largest): 1) Budgetary Central Government; 2) Central Government, which includes Budgetary Central Government as well as extra-budgetary units ; and 3) General Government, which includes Central, State and Local Government. Countries that fully report General Government Expenditures may not report Central Government Expenditures.\n Since not all countries collect or share data on all three levels of reporting, the level with the most complete time series is used is used for each country. To the extent that the Agriculture share of Government Expenditures differs across levels of government (Central, State and Local), differences in this indicator may reflect differences in reporting.\n Sub-national estimates\n It is not possible to compute sub-national or population group estimates, given the nature of the underlying data.","There is no baseline value for this indicator for 2015. There is some precedent for using government expenditures as a target indicator for Agriculture. Signatories to the Maputo Declaration set a target of 10% for the Agriculture and Rural Development Share of Government Expenditures. However, as Rural Development is not a purpose listed under the COFOG classification, there has been considerable difficulty in consistently measuring this indicator. Furthermore, in setting a universal target, this Share indicator suffers from the problems listed above (comparison of economies of different size, with different levels of government expenditures, and with different agricultural shares of GDP).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mean and standard deviation of the observed historic CGR values define what is considered to be ""normal""volatility for the particular price series being considered. A ""Price Anomaly"" is then defined as the recording, in a given month, of a CGR that is greater than the historic mean CGR for that month by one standard deviation or more.","Computation of the indicator requires the availability of a series of monthly prices and involves three steps.\n Step 1. Calculating the quarterly and annual compound growth rates. A CGR is the growth rate in a time series over a certain amount of time.\n It is computed as [see report].\n A quarterly CGR (CQGR) is calculated by considering periods of three months between ____ and __0, while an annual CGR (CAGR) is calculated by considering a period of 12 months. The importance to consider both CQGR and CAGR derives from the need to take into account the presence of marked seasonal variability in many agricultural prices, with prices growing more or less steadily over the year from their minimum, occurring at harvest period.\n Step 2. Calculating the weighted average and standard deviation of both CQGR and CAGR. The historic distributions of CGRs are characterized by the mean and the standard deviation of past CGR values. A different distribution of CGRs is computed per each calendar month. Time weights are used to make sure that the more recent past has a higher weight in the calculation of the mean and standard deviation of the distribution of CGRs, so that more recent price dynamics are not overshadowed by past extreme events which could prevent the detection of significant market shocks on prices. \n Step 4. Computing the indicator of price anomalies. First, the difference between the monthly CGR and the historic average CGR is computed for each month and then normalized with respect to the historic standard deviation. Based on the results, a price anomaly is recorded in each month for which the normalized difference is equal or greater than one. Then, the frequency of price anomalies is computed for both the quarterly and the annual CGRs and the final indicator of price anomalies for month t (________ ) is computed as a weighted average of the frequency of price anomalies in the quarterly CGR and the frequency of price anomalies based on the annual CGR.\n For further details, see Baquedano 2014 (2015?)","The indicator aims at capturing the occurrence of episodes of abrupt price increases that could be indicative of malfunctioning food commodity markets, and as such can be used to monitor the ""proper functioning"" of food markets, as expressed by the Target.\n Evidence from existing historic price series will need to be evaluated, on a case-by-case basis to determine which price series are more relevant in each country.\n As this is a ""means of implementation"" indicator, there should be no need to set baseline values and numerical targets to be achieved by 2030, but only to report it.",,,,,,,"Price series have been collected over the years on several food commodities in many countries to inform the FAO Food Price Monitoring and Analysis (FPMA) tool as detailed at http://www.fao.org/giews/food-prices/data-partners/en/.\n Adoption of this indicator will require that countries identify relevant, official monthly food price series to be used to inform the calculations, and that ensure data collection and publication on a monthly basis.",,,"The indicator is applicable at the level of the relevant market for which price data are available.

Measurement requires information on pregnancy status, timing of death (during pregnancy, childbirth, or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy), and cause of death. \nThe maternal mortality ratio can be calculated directly from data collected through vital registration systems, household surveys or other sources. There are often data quality problems, particularly related to the underreporting and misclassification of maternal deaths. Therefore, data are often adjusted in order to take these data quality issues into account. \nBecause maternal mortality is a relatively rare event, large sample sizes are needed if household surveys are used to identify recent maternal deaths in the household (e.g. last year). This may still result in estimates with large confidence intervals, limiting the usefulness for cross_country or over_time comparisons. \nTo reduce sample size requirements, the sisterhood method used in the DHS and multiple indicator surveys (MICS4) measures maternal mortality by asking respondents about the survival of sisters. It should be noted that the sisterhood method results in pregnancy_related mortality: regardless of the cause of death, all deaths occurring during pregnancy, birth or the six weeks following the termination of the pregnancy are included in the numerator of the maternal mortality ratio. \nCensuses have also included questions about maternal deaths with variable success. \nReproductive Age Mortality Studies (RAMOS) is a special study that uses varied sources, depending on the context, to identify all deaths of women of reproductive age and ascertain which of these deaths are maternal or pregnancy_ related. \nMethod of estimation \nFor facility data_based maternal mortality, the denominator is estimated using population projections. \nWHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, the United Nations Population Division and The World Bank have developed a method to adjust existing data in order to take into account these data quality issues and ensure the comparability of different data sources. This method involves assessment of data for completeness and, where necessary, adjustment for underreporting and misclassification of deaths as well as development of estimates through statistical modelling for countries with no reliable national level data. \nData on maternal mortality and other relevant variables are obtained through databases maintained by WHO, the United Nations Population Division, UNICEF, and The World Bank. Data available from countries varies in terms of source and methods. Given the variability of the sources of data, different methods are used for each data source in order to arrive at country estimates that are comparable and permit regional and global aggregation. \nCurrently, only about one third of all countries/territories have reliable data available and do not need additional estimations. For about half of the countries included in the estimation process, country_reported estimates of maternal mortality are adjusted for the purposes of comparability of the methodologies.

The percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel is calculated as the number of births attended by skilled health personnel (doctors, nurses or midwives) expressed as a percentage of the total number of births in the same period. Births attended by skilled health personnel = (number of births attended by skilled health personnel)/(total number of live births) x 100.

A 'brief intervention' is a structured therapy of short duration aimed at assisting an individual to cease or reduce the use of a psychoactive substance or to deal with other life issues (WHO). \n\tContingency management' refers to psychosocial interventions that provide a system of incentives and disincentives designed to make drug use less attractive and abstinence more attractive (NIDA). \n\tCognitive behavioural therapy refers to psychosocial interventions aimed at helping patients recognize, avoid and cope with the situations in which they are most likely to use drugs (adapted from NIDA). \n\tMotivational interviewing refers to a counselling and assessment technique that follows a non-confrontational approach to questioning people about difficult issues like alcohol and drug use, assisting them to make positive decisions aimed at reducing or stopping such use (ODCCP). \nSocial rehabilitation and aftercare include a cluster of interventions such as vocational training, social assistance, educational activities, rehabilitation and aftercare. \n\tVocational training and income-generation support' refers to activities aimed at providing participants with the skills and opportunities to engage in meaningful employment and sustainably support themselves and their families. \n\tSocial assistance refers to the many ways in which professionals and nonprofessionals can support the social and psychological well-being of drug users with a view to improving both the quality and duration of their lives (WHO, Guidelines for the Psychosocially Assisted Pharmacological Treatment of Opioid Dependence, 2009). \n\tEducational activities on the risks posed by drug use refer to sessions aimed at informing and counselling people about the consequences of drug use, in other words, the ways in which such use affects physical and mental health, behavioural control and interpersonal relationships. In particular, these educational sessions should focus on providing information about overdosing, contracting infectious diseases, developing cardiovascular, metabolic and psychiatric disorders etc. and the benefit of abstaining from drug use. Treatment methods and goals are also explained in detail. \n\tRehabilitation and aftercare refers to the process aimed at achieving an optimal state of health, psychological functioning and social well-being for individuals with a drugrelated problem (WHO). \nCoverage Coverage describes the extent to which an intervention is delivered to the target population, that is, the proportion of the target population in need of an intervention that actually gets it.

Modern methods of contraception include female and male sterilization, oral hormonal pills, intra-uterine devices (IUD), male condoms, injectables, implants (including Norplant), vaginal barrier methods, female condoms, and emergency contraception. Traditional methods of contraception include the rhythm method (periodic abstinence), withdrawal, lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) and folk methods.","Number of women with family planning demand who use modern methods / Total number of women in need of family planning \nMethod of measurement \nHousehold surveys include a series of questions to measure modern contraceptive prevalence rate and demand for family planning.\nTotal demand for family planning is defined as the sum of the number of women of reproductive age (15'49 years) who are married or in a union and who are currently using, or whose sexual partner is currently using, at least one contraceptive method, and the unmet need for family planning. Unmet need for family planning is the proportion of women of reproductive age (15'49 years) either married or in a consensual union, who are fecund and sexually active but who are not using any method of contraception (modern or traditional), and report not wanting any more children or wanting to delay the birth of their next child for at least two years. Included are: (i) all pregnant women (married or in a consensual union) whose pregnancies were unwanted or mistimed at the time of conception; (ii) all postpartum amenorrhoeic women (married or in consensual union) who are not using family planning and whose last birth was unwanted or mistimed; (iii) all fecund women (married or in consensual union) who are neither pregnant nor postpartum amenorrhoeic, and who either do not want any more children (want to limit family size), or who wish to postpone the birth of a child for at least two years or do not know when or if they want another child (want to space births), but are not using any contraceptive method.\n\nFrom Population Division/DESA, United Nations: \nThe numerator is the percentage of women of reproductive age (15-49 years old) who are currently using, or whose sexual partner is currently using, at least one modern contraceptive method. The denominator is the total demand for family planning (the sum of contraceptive prevalence (any method) and the unmet need for family planning. \nMetadata on the definition, method of computation and other information for each component' contraceptive prevalence and unmet need for family planning'are included in the MDG database as each was an indicator (5.3 and 5.6) used for global monitoring of MDG target 5.B. Achieve, by 2015, universal access to reproductive health. An important limitation, though, of the indicators used in MDG monitoring is that they were only with reference to women of reproductive age who are married or in a union. The indicators missed women who are not married but who are exposed to the risk of pregnancy. \nSee http://unstats.un.org/unsd/mdg/Metadata.aspx \nThe proposed indicator limits the numerator to women who are using a modern method of family planning. Women who are using a traditional method of contraception are not considered as having a met need for family planning. \nIn contrast, the indicator 'Demand for family planning satisfied (met need for contraception)' (regardless if the method used is modern or traditional).is a key indicator under the Every Woman, Every Child initiative and is described in detail in the handbook 'Monitoring maternal, newborn and child health: understanding key progress indicators' available here from WHO (2011): http://www.who.int/entity/healthmetrics/news/monitoring_maternal_newborn_child_health.pdf.\n\nFrom UNFPA: \n ( Women using a contraceptive method / Women of reproductive age ) X 100","From Population Division/DESA, United Nations: \nWhile it is difficult to define an ideal level of contraceptive prevalence, since it is dependent, in part, on women's and men fertility preferences, the proportion of demand for family planning satisfied can be interpreted as the degree to which total demand for contraception has been met with an ideal (if improbable) target of 100 per cent demand met. \n""The proportion of demand for family planning satisfied (met need for contraception) indicator enables assessment of family planning programmes and progress in providing contraceptive services to women who wish to avoid getting pregnant. Access to family planning provides women and their partners opportunities to make decisions about family size and timing of pregnancies. This contributes to maternal and child health by preventing unintended pregnancies and pregnancies that are too closely spaced, which are at higher risk for poor obstetrical outcomes. Unmet need for family planning shows the gap between women's reproductive intentions and their access to or use of contraceptives. The CPR provides an estimate of contraceptive use in a population. Both the unmet need for family planning and CPR indicators are used for tracking progress towards the MDG 5 target 5B of achieving universal access to reproductive health."" (WHO, 2011)\n\nFrom UNFPA: \n The contraceptive prevalence rate, which serves as a proxy measure of access to reproductive health services, is useful for tracking progress towards the target of achieving universal access to reproductive health, especially when the indicator is considered in conjunction with information about women's knowledge of family planning or accessibility, and the quality of family planning services. Information on contraceptive prevalence complements the indicator of unmet need for family planning. The sum of contraceptive prevalence and unmet need determines the total demand for contraception. Unlike the unmet need indicator, contraceptive prevalence does not take into account whether women or couples do or do not desire additional children. This makes the indicator more difficult to interpret than unmet need because contraceptive prevalence rates vary across societies with vastly different preferred family sizes. For the same reason, it is difficult to specify the desired target for contraceptive prevalence rates.",Service coverage,"Reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health",,,,,"From WHO:\nPopulation_based health surveys.\n\nFrom Population Division/DESA, United Nations: \n Data are from household surveys that are internationally-coordinated, such as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS) and national surveys based on similar methodologies. These surveys tend to be undertaken every three to five years. Other survey programmes, like the Pan-Arab Project for Family Health (PAPFAM) and the European Fertility and Family Surveys (FFS) may be considered as well. \nData are available for 138 countries and territories for the period 1990-2014; 90 countries and territories have at least two available data points. \n183 countries and territories have data on contraceptive prevalence (one component of this indicator); \n156 countries and territories have at least two data points.\n\nFrom UNFPA: \n Contraceptive prevalence rates are calculated from nationally representative surveys with questions on current use of contraception. Surveys that commonly include this information are: Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Fertility and Family Surveys (FFS), Reproductive Health Surveys (RHS) conducted with assistance of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) and other national surveys. \nSurveys gather information on contraceptive prevalence through direct questions to women. These questions often include two parts: a general question asking women if they are currently using a method of contraception and a follow-up question regarding the type of contraceptive method currently used. In order to obtain an accurate measure of contraceptive prevalence, it is desirable for the survey interviewer to provide a description or a list of the specific methods of family planning. If this is not done, the level of contraceptive use may be significantly underreported, especially where the use of traditional methods such as withdrawal or calendar rhythm, or use of contraceptive sterilization, is common. In some surveys, such as the DHS, the methods are described in a series of ""probe"" questions about methods the respondent has heard about, before the respondent is asked about current use of contraception. In highly literate populations, the interviewer might provide the respondent with a printed list of the methods. \nIn recording data on the type of contraceptive method used, it is important to keep in mind that some respondents may use more than one method at a time. In such cases, a selection is either made a posteriori by the survey enumerator based on the effectiveness of the methods used or by respondents based on their own assessment of the method they used most frequently. Identifying only one method or combination of methods per respondent allows contraceptive prevalence to be computed as the sum of levels of use of each method. If more than one method or combination of methods is recorded per respondent and no selection criteria are employed, the sum of the various methods used may exceed the overall level of contraceptive prevalence. \nIt is also important to note that contraceptive prevalence is measured at the time of interview. There is, however, a lag, generally between one and two years, between the date of an interview and the diffusion of the survey report. On average, the surveys are undertaken every three to five years.",,Every 3-5 years,"From WHO: Age, marital status, place of residence, socioeconomic status. \n\nFrom UNFPA: \n Contraceptive use may vary significantly across socioeconomic groups and regional and geographical areas. For policy purposes, information on contraceptive prevalence should be disaggregated, at a minimum, by age and current marital status. This information is important because it allows monitoring of differences in access to contraceptive methods for more vulnerable groups such as adolescents and unmarried women. \nContraceptive use can be disaggregated by other social or economic characteristics, such as the woman's level of educational attainment, urban or rural residence, and number of own children as relevant for the policy needs of each country or area.","From Population Division/DESA, United Nations: \n Country-specific data from surveys are used for regional and global monitoring (as noted above). \nIn order to generate regional and global estimates for any given reference year, the Population Division/DESA uses a Bayesian hierarchical model. Country-level, model-based estimates are only used for computing the regional and global averages and are not used for global monitoring of trends at the country level. Country-specific estimates are generated by using the general relationship between contraceptive prevalence and unmet need, a quadratic function to summarize the 'world pattern', country-specific intercepts to capture the different levels within countries (estimated using a hierarchical model based on sub-regional information) and non-parametric changes over time to capture fluctuations around the expected trend. The fewer the number of observations for the country of interest, the more its estimates are driven by the experience of other countries, whereas for countries with many observations the results are determined to a greater extent by those observations. \nRegional and global estimates are weighted averages of the model-based country estimates, using the number of married or in-union women aged 15-49 for the reference year in each country (for MDG monitoring purposes). Regional averages are provided only if data are available for at least 50 per cent of the women of reproductive age who are married or in union in the region.\n\nFrom UNFPA: \n Data for this indicator are reported at the global level by the United Nations Population Division. Data are obtained from national repositories or from published survey reports. In exceptional cases, data are taken from other published analytic reports. If clarification is needed, contact is made with the survey sponsors or authoring organization, which may supply corrected or adjusted estimates in response. \nRegional estimates are weighted averages of the country data, using the number of married or inunion women aged 15-49 for the reference year in each country as the weight. Global estimates are weighted averages of the regional estimates, using the number of married or in-union women aged 15- 49 in each region as the weight. No figures are reported if less than 50 per cent of the married or inunion women in the region are covered.","From UNFPA: \n Differences in survey design and implementation, as well as differences in the way survey questionnaires are formulated and administered can affect the comparability of data over time, and between countries. Some of the most common differences are the range of contraceptive methods included in the surveys, and whether or not probe questions are included on the types of methods used. The lack of probe questions can result in an underestimation of contraceptive prevalence. \nThe characteristics (age, sex, marital or union status) of the persons for whom contraceptive prevalence is measured (base population) also affects the comparability of data on contraceptive prevalence. Although the standard definition of the contraceptive prevalence rate refers only to women who are married or in union, alternative base populations are sometimes presented including sexually active women (irrespective of marital status), ever-married women, or men and women who are married or in union. \nThe time frame used to assess contraceptive prevalence can also vary. Often it is left to the respondent to determine what is meant by 'currently using' a method of contraception. Some surveys ask about use within the past month. Occasionally, when information on current use is not collected, data on use of contraceptive methods at last sexual intercourse or during the previous year has been utilized to estimate current contraceptive prevalence. Any differences between the data presented and the standard definition of contraceptive prevalence should be clearly indicated. \nSampling variability can also be an issue in data collection, especially when contraceptive prevalence is measured for a specific subgroup (according to method, age-group, level of educational attainment, place of residence, etc) or when analyzing trends over time.","From UNFPA: \n Statistics on contraception prevalence rates are based primarily on women. This is mostly for pragmatic reasons, because the majority of contraceptive methods are female-based. But it can also be argued that the degree to which women control their reproduction is an indicator of the degree to which they control their own lives in general, thereby converting the contraceptive prevalence rate into an indicator of women's empowerment. Recent surveys have also interviewed samples of men about contraceptive use.",,,"From WHO: \nCountdown to 2015. Monitoring maternal, newborn and child health: understanding key progress indicators.

The numerator is the number of live births to women aged 15-19 years, and the denominator is an estimate of exposure to childbearing by women aged 15-19 years. The numerator and the denominator are calculated differently for civil registration and survey and census data. \nCivil registration: In the case of civil registration the numerator is the registered number of live births born to women aged 15-19 years during a given year, and the denominator is the estimated or enumerated population of women aged 15-19 years.'' \nSurvey data: In the case of survey data, the adolescent birth rate is generally computed on the basis of retrospective birth histories. The numerator refers to births to women who were 15-19 years of age at the time of the birth during a reference period before the interview, and the denominator to person_years lived between the ages of 15 and 19 years by the interviewed women during the same reference period. Whenever possible, the reference period corresponds to the five years preceding the survey. The reported observation year corresponds to the middle of the reference period. For some surveys, no retrospective birth histories are available and the estimate is based on the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the survey.'' \nCensus data: With census data, the adolescent birth rate is generally computed on the basis of the date of last birth or the number of births in the 12 months preceding the enumeration. The census provides both the numerator and the denominator for the rates. In some cases, the rates based on censuses are adjusted for under_registration based on indirect methods of estimation. For some countries with no other reliable data, the own_children method of indirect estimation provides estimates of the adolescent birth rate for a number of years before the census (See: http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/Metadata.aspx, accessed 19 October 2009.) \nIf numbers are available, adolescent fertility at ages under 15 years can also be computed. \nMethod of estimation \nThe United Nations Population Division compiles and updates data on adolescent fertility rates for MDG monitoring. Estimates based on civil registration are provided when the country reports at least 90% coverage and there is reasonable agreement between civil registration estimates and survey estimates. Survey estimates are provided only when there is no reliable civil registration. Given the restrictions of the United Nations MDG database, only one source is provided by year and country. In such cases precedence is given to the survey programme conducted most frequently at the country level, with other survey programmes using retrospective birth histories, census and other surveys in that order.

Population census, household surveys \n\nFrom Population Division/DESA, United Nations: \nIn all developed countries and in several developing countries, data on births by age of mother are obtained from civil registration systems covering 90 per cent or more of all live births, supplemented eventually by census or survey estimates for periods when registration data are not available. In developing countries lacking a civil registration system or where the coverage of that system is lower than 90 per cent of all live births, the adolescent birth rate is obtained from household survey data and census data. Registration data regarded as less than 90 per cent complete are exceptionally used for countries where the alternative sources present problems of compatibility and registration data can provide an assessment of trends.

WPP considers potentially as many types and sources of empirical estimates as possible (including retrospective birth histories, direct and indirect fertility estimates), and the final estimates are derived to ensure as much internal consistency as possible with all other demographic components and intercensal cohorts enumerated in successive censuses. The advantages are that the estimates are internally consistent within a country and with respect to other related demographic information, you have better comparability over time within a country and can compare across countries at one time period. The disadvantage is that the estimates can depart from what a country considers its official estimates of adolescent fertility. Furthermore the estimates are available only in five-year periods. Several agencies use the WPP series in their publications and on-line databases. For instance, the World Bank database uses this series for internal consistency purposes (they draw on other population measures from WPP).",,,,,"From WHO: \nFramework of actions for the follow_up to the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development beyond 2014.

Moreover, since FGM/C is regarded as a traditional practice prejudicial to the health of children and is, in most cases, performed on minors, it violates the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Existing national legislation in many countries also include explicit bans against FGM/C. \n\nFrom WHO: \n Female genital mutilation (FGM) comprises all procedures that involve the partial or total removal of external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons [1]. Although it is internationally recognized as a violation of human rights (including: the right to non-discrimination on the grounds of sex; the right to life; the right to the highest attainable standard of health; the right to freedom From torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment; and the rights of the child), and legislation to prohibit the procedure has been put in place in many countries, the practice has still been documented. \nWHO classifies FGM into four types: [1] \n\tType I: Partial or total removal of the clitoris and/or the prepuce (clitoridectomy). \n\tType II: Partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora, with or without excision of the labia majora (excision). \n\tType III: Narrowing of the vaginal orifice with the creation of a covering seal by cutting and appositioning the labia minora and/or the labia majora, with or without excision of the clitoris (infibulation). \n\tType IV: All other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, for example: pricking, pulling, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterization. \nThe removal of or damage to healthy, normal genital tissue interferes with the natural functioning of the body and causes several immediate and long-term health consequences.",,,,,,,"From UNICEF: \nHousehold surveys such as UNICEF-supported MICS and DHS have been collecting data on this indicator in low- and middle-income countries since the late 1980s.

As a result of their socially ascribed roles, women and girls do the bulk of unpaid care and domestic work, which includes household maintenance activities such as cooking and cleaning as well as person-toperson care activities such as child and elder care.

An independent survey is often a good solution for a subject as complex as time use. However, multi-purpose household surveys can also be used to produce time use statistics, for example through a modular approach [1]. \nBased on data compiled by UN Women in 2015, 75 countries currently have data related to this indicator.

Hence, arriving at an average for a representative week, instead of day, is deemed more appropriate. [1] \nThis indicator is part of the minimum set of gender indicators agreed by the UN Statistical Commission in 2013 [3].","With the availability of time use statistics on hours spent on paid and unpaid work, the extent of the gender gaps in division of unpaid work can be examined. \nBased on available data, women devote on average 2.5 more time on unpaid care and domestic work than men: when both paid and unpaid total workloads are combined, women work more than men, resulting in more time poverty for them [4]. On the intergenerational transmission of gender roles, according to ILO (2009) 10 percent of girls aged 5 to 14 perform household chores for 28 hours a week or more, representing approximately twice the hours spent by boys, resulting in lower school attendance.

They may participate as voters, candidates for local, regional and national elections, members of parliament or local council, heads of state and government, ministers, members of political parties, trade unions or business associations, or as electoral administrators. \nCapturing an accurate assessment of women's representation across these different forms of political participation has been difficult, however. The standard measure of women's political participation and involvement in decision-making, used to track progress for the Millennium Development Goals, was the proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments. In many respects, the existence and quality of this data has meant that other areas of political participation have not been paid sufficient attention. \nMeasuring women's participation in local government is an additional, but equally important measure of women's political participation and decision-making, because of the responsibilities of local governments and the significantly higher number of opportunities (that is seats) available to women candidates at this level. Women's entry into local politics has the potential to influence a wide range of policy decisions and local community programmes. \nHowever, the available data is limited; it is neither comprehensive across all countries, nor regularly updated. Data from the United Nations Statistical Division's 2010 edition of The World's Women, for example, show selected regional averages, with a low of 8 percent in Northern Africa to a high of 30 percent in sub-Saharan Africa. Averages across Latin America and Europe ranged from 24 to 29 percent and Asia reported averages below 20 percent. Drawing meaningful conclusions from this data is therefore difficult. \nIn 1995, the Beijing Platform for Action called on governments to accept a wider understanding of women's participation in decision-making that went beyond women in national politics. The 20-year review of the Platform, however, found that: \n\ta significant challenge for effectively monitoring progress towards gender equality is the lack of high quality and comparable data, collected over time. Many areas of statistics that are of critical importance such as ' women's participation in decision-making at all levels, including local government ' are still not produced regularly by countries. Data and statistical requirements for the post-2015 development agenda will be substantial, particularly for monitoring gender equality, women's empowerment and the human rights of women and girls in the new framework. \nA dedicated indicator on women's political participation would provide the necessary 'data mandate' to ensure this data set is more systematically collected across all countries and regularly monitored over time, allowing for both international and longitudinal comparisons.",,,,,,,"To date, the main global and regional sources of data on women's political participation at the local level have included: the UN Statistics Division's report, The World's Women; United Cities and Local Government (UCLG) country profiles; Member States' inputs to the SG Report on the implementation of General Assembly Resolution 66/130 on women and political participation; CEDAW country reports (a total of 122 countries have reported some information on women's representation at local level); and national government sources including Permanent Missions to the United Nations. \nThe United Nations Regional Commissions have also played an important role collecting data on women's political participation at the local level. There are consistent data on women's participation in local government published on the websites of two Regional Commissions: the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America (UN-ECLAC). (See Annex 1 for more information.) \nAs the data is not comparable across countries and regions, a standardised data collection methodology ' including guidelines ' needs to be developed.",,,,"No organisation has to date developed a global repository of data on women's political participation at the local level. This, however, would be essential for any future global indicator. The most likely candidate is United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG), a global organization representing local governments, although it is expected that guidance and capacity building would be required. Data could also be collected on a regional basis, in which case, the role of the United Nations Regional Commissions could be strengthened, led by United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (UN-ECLAC) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), which are already collecting data on women's representation in local governments in their respective regions.\n\n On the basis of an agreed tier structure, data would be collected using a pre-prepared template for each country, with the identified tiers of government. The typology would be shared with national statistics offices in original language, to be populated with relevant data. The data itself would typically be an 'administrative record'. This process is similar to that used by the Inter-Parliamentary Union in collecting data on women's participation in national parliaments. Data would be collected for each country at the same point in time (e.g. 1 January of each year), to capture ""current"" the number of women in local government at that time. This allows for time comparability. Data would need to be entered into a global repository (database), held by the entity for global monitoring, but made publicly available for potential review.",,,"Local governments exist in every country, and in theory, data could be collected from each one. Available data on women's participation in local government, however, has suffered from the following limitations: \n\tinconsistent data coverage over time (some countries report regularly while others report less frequently, if at all) which results in an absence of trend data to show progress and setbacks; \n\tan absence of common baseline data, or a global repository of data; \n\ta lack of clear definitions of local government structures to be measured resulting in variation in the names and functions of the local government structures measured; \n\tconflation of data on councillors with data on mayor positions; \n\ta lack of clear methodological guidelines for data collection processes. \nIn attempting to address some of the challenges with existing data, UN Women has begun work on a new typology that reflects the diverse range of local government systems, to allow for international comparison. Research was commissioned on the sub-national administrative structures in 193 UN Member States. Data on each country's governance structure was collected from a combination of national government websites and secondary sources. This research distinguished the following ""tiers"" of local government: \n\tA first tier of local government could be identified as ""the district"" or ""the department"" and would include municipal corporations, administrative divisions and self-governing territories (estimated to apply to 92 countries). \n\tA second tier of local government could be identified as ""the municipality"" and would comprise cities, towns and other small urban agglomerations, usually headed by a mayor (estimated to apply to 178 countries). \n\tA third tier of local government might be identified as ""the rural village"", more prevalent in large countries with highly populated regional centres (estimated to apply to 48 countries). \n\tAdditional tiers, where required, could be identified as ""small villages"" and ""neighbourhoods"", responsible for arbitrating local disputes and liaising between formal and informal authorities, but with little financial authority (estimated to apply to 5 countries).","From IPU:\n The IPU suggests to develop an aggregate indicator which would cover women in ministerial positions, parliament and local government. This would provide for a comprehensive picture of women's participation in political decision-making structures. The IPU collects data on women in national parliaments; it also collects data on women in ministerial positions (for the past 10 years now). The proposal would allow to build on already existing data and methodologies, and make use of available capacities. It would also enable to include new data, collected by the UN, on local government.

Interviewees will have to provide a 'yes' answer to all three questions in order to count as a woman who makes her own sexual and reproductive decisions. The first question looks at the ability to say no to sexual intercourse as a critical condition of sexual autonomy. The second question measures the woman's decision concerning using or not using contraception. The third question measures the woman's decision about reaching sexual and reproductive healthcare for her. \nThe three questions are as follows: \n\t1. Whether a woman can say no to her husband/partner if she does not want to have sexual intercourse (DHS q. 1054) \n\t2. Whether using contraception or not using contraception has been mainly the woman's decision (DHS phase 7 q. 819 and 820) \n\t3. Whether a woman can make a decision about sexual and reproductive healthcare for herself (DHS q.922 with added language) \n\n From UNFPA: \n The indicator is based on three central elements measuring the empowerment of women (married, in union and ever sexually active women) aged 15-49 to make the following decisions, : (a) whether they are able to reject unwanted sexual relations; (b) using or not using contraception; and (c) whether they can access sexual and reproductive health care for herself.","From UN-WOMEN: \nDenominator: \nWomen of reproductive age 15-49 \nMeasurement: \n\nIndicator will be measured through DHS and MICS covering most of low and middle income countries. In developed countries the indicator will be measured through national household surveys \n\n From UNFPA \n \n\tThe methodology for this indicator has been developed by UNFPA in close collaboration with UN Women by building on available information from DHS surveys. These three questions are already included in the DHS: (a) DHS q. 1054; (b) DHS Phase 7, q. 819 & 820; (c) DHS q. 922). In all cases these questions are currently asked to women married or in union. Therefore the denominator will need to be expanded to include ever sexually active women. In the case of the last question, the current DHS question just refers to 'healthcare for herself', not specifically SRH care, which will need to be added. \n\tUNFPA is also compiling and analyzing data from available countries across different regions to understand better how the indicator behaves and whether some additional tweaking will be needed in the formulation of the indicator and its specific components. \n\tIn DHS, the indicator is already disaggregated by location, economic quintile, and education. For the component related to contraceptive use the indicator is also disaggregated by method of contraception. The proposal is to add age, marital status (married, in union, unmarried) and disability.",,,,,,,,,,,"From UN-WOMEN: \n By age, location, economic quintile, education, marital status (married, in union, unmarried), and disability.","From UNFPA: \n For the time being, this indicator is available in approximately 70 countries covered by DHS. Meanwhile, UNFPA is holding conversations with MICS and other organizations to incorporate these questions in other surveys with a view to covering all countries on a global scale. While a combination of DHS and MICS would cover most low and middle-income countries, the possibility to integrate these questions in the gender and generations survey run by UNECE in several European countries and World values survey would ensure near universal coverage. A few high middle income countries such as Brazil and Mexico run their own national surveys, which tend to be similar in content to DHS.","From UNFPA: \n UNFPA advocates for the expansion of the age range of several indicators in the SDG framework that currently rely on DHS and MICS as primary sources of information. This is critical in order to better assess the health, education and general wellbeing of very young adolescents, particularly adolescent girls aged 10-14, at a critical point in their lives in which they transition from childhood to adulthood and are exposed to specific vulnerabilities that can hamper their physical and emotional integrity and their actual development as empowered rights-holders. While this is a central concern for UNFPA, expanding the age range for indicator 5.6.1 poses particular challenges. On the one hand, household surveys would not be the most appropriate tools to capture this information given the way these surveys are designed and rolled-out. On the other hand, the ability for a very young girl to make sexual and reproductive decisions has to be seen in light of legal considerations such as the 'minimum age of consent to sexual relations' and the 'evolving capacity of the child'. For instance a very young girl who declares that she can say 'yes' to sexual intercourse may not have the level of maturity or the minimum age of consent to make a valid autonomous decision in that regard. Beyond normative and ethical considerations, these legal variables differ a lot from country to country, thus making it difficult to ensure comparability of data. It will be less problematic to capture information on the situation of very young adolescent girls through other indicators such as those related to sexual and gender-based violence (5.2) and child marriage (5.3).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plus, they can be computed using (almost) the same data, the main difference between the 2 parts being only the denominator. \n Definition of agricultural land: \nSince Target 1.4 explicitly refers to equal rights on economic resources, the proposed indicator focuses on land that can be used as a productive resource for livelihood development, thus the focus on agricultural land. \nThe focus on land as productive resource (or for livelihood development) helps deriving indication on empowerment and advancement towards poverty reduction, compared to lands used for other purposes that are not economically and livelihood-related. This is particularly true in developing countries where poverty reduction strategies are necessarily linked to agricultural development. \nThe term 'agricultural land' is used to indicate land used for farming, livestock and forestry activities. This emphasizes the importance to monitor ownership/secure rights on land of farm-based livelihood people as well as people whose main source of livelihood is livestock and forestry. \nSimilarly the term 'agricultural population' has to be intended in a broad sense ' i.e. including people living out of farming, livestock and forestry, with land rights or without (landless). \nDefinition of ownership and rights over land: \nThe landowner is the legal owner of the land. Definitions of ownership may vary across countries and surveys. For instance, documented ownership means that ownership is verified through title or deed, while reported ownership relies on individuals' own judgment. Reported ownership may be more appropriate in countries where a formal registration system is not in place. \nAdditionally, in some countries, particularly where land private ownership is not applicable, it is more appropriate to investigate rights over land using proxies able to capture individuals' capability to control and take decisions over the land. This may include settings where customary rights prevail as opposed to individual ownership. Proxies of such ""bundle of rights"" may include the right to sell, to bequeath or the right to decide how to use the land. \nSince the definition of ownership and land rights has to take into account what is more relevant in the country, the indicator will need to be complemented with metadata that specify what definition(s) of ownership or rights over land is/are employed. \nTenure Type \nFinally and most importantly, this indicator has to be disaggregated by type of tenure. Therefore, the data collection methodology should always include a question on land tenure. Land tenure refers to the arrangements or rights under which people have access to land, and it is one of the key elements to tenure security.5 There are different formal and informal tenure systems around the world and the distinction between legal and non-legal tenure is often blurred. When available, the indicator shall also be disaggregated by documented tenure rights. \nThe FAO World Census of Agriculture encourages countries to use country-specific types of tenure whilst ensuring the possibility to classify ex-post under the following broad categories: 1) legal ownership or legal owner-like possession; 2) Non-legal ownership or non-legal owner-like possession; 3) Rented land from someone else; 4) Various other types of land tenure. \nBroadly speaking, legal ownership or legal owner-like possession describes land rights that provide statutory security of tenure. This may be done through a formal land title system, but may also include certain forms of customary land tenure arrangements where land rights are registered or certified in some way. The following types of tenure arrangements may be included under this heading: \n\tOwnership is certified through a title, which gives the individual the right to determine the nature and extent of the use of the land. \n\tLand is held under conditions that enable it to be operated as if legally owned. E.g., the land is operated under hereditary tenure, perpetual lease, or long-term lease, with nominal or no rent. \n\tThe land is held under a tribal, communal, or traditional form of tenure, which is legally recognized by the state. Such arrangements usually involve land being held on a tribal, village, kindred or clan basis, with land ownership being communal in character but with certain individual rights being held by virtue of membership in the social unit. Such arrangements can be formalized through the establishment of legal procedures to identify the community's land and to manage the land rights of community members.","We propose using the 'total agricultural population' as denominator of part (a), instead of the total population, because ownership or right-security over agricultural land is obviously relevant only for the people whose livelihood rely on agriculture. \nPart (a) \n( People with ownership or secure rights over agricultural land / Total agricultural population ) * 100 \nPart (b) \n( Women with ownership or rights over agricultural land / Total owners or rights bearers over agricultural land ) * 100",,,,"The indicator is related to Goal 1, target 1.4: ""By 2030, ensure that all men and women, in particular the poor and the vulnerable, have equal rights to economic resources, as well as access to basic services, ownership and control over land and other forms of property, inheritance, natural resources, appropriate new technology and financial services, including microfinance.""\nMore specifically, this indicator monitors ""ownership and rights over land"" and it is particularly useful in terms of framing gender differences in land ownership and control whilst relating them specifically to the population of interest, namely the people who own land or with rights over land. As such it gives a clearer picture of gender and social inequalities in land ownership/control, than for instance looking at the incidence of female ownership/control over land in the entire population of a country. An increase in the percentage of women owning/controlling land indicates that, within the population of interest (i.e., the landowners/rights bearers), progress is made towards achieving equal rights over land among men and women.","The indicator already exists. Until now, the indicator has been collected mainly through the LSMS-ISA surveys and to a smaller extent through DHS surveys in collaboration with National Institutes of Statistics. At the time of writing, the indicator is readily available for 11 countries. Additional, but yet unprocessed surveys (e.g., DHS, LSMS, national household income and expenditure surveys etc.) lead to a conservative estimate of an additional 10 countries for which the indicator could be derived. It cannot be excluded that many other surveys not currently available to FAO would be potential sources as well, for countries not covered by LSMS or DHS. \nThanks to a fruitful cooperation with IFPRI-PIM, FAO is already disseminating the available data for through the Gender and Land Rights Database (GRLD; http://www.fao.org/gender/landrights/home/en/). In the next future, the same data will be also disseminated through FAO's Rural Livelihood Monitoring (RLM) platform. The new World Programme for Agricultural Census (WCA 2020) has proposed the collection of land ownership data disaggregated by sex as a supplementary item. Furthermore, the FAO Statistics Division is starting a project called AGRIS (Agricultural Integrated Surveys) through which methodological guidelines will be provided to countries on how to conduct farm surveys (i.e. key indicators to collect, definitions, methods for data collection, periodicity, etc.), and effort will also be made to support countries in the actual implementation of the farm surveys. By doing so, the availability of this indicator will increase substantially in the future. \nWhile comparability across countries (mainly due to differing definitions) and low current availability pose a challenge to this indicator, it is still fair to consider the indicator superior to the ""share of female agricultural holders"" ' widely available through agricultural census data- because it provides intra-holding/household information and is usually made available in a shorter time span. \nIt also worth mentioning that the importance of a sex-disaggregated indicator on land is acknowledged in the Minimum Set of Gender Indicators approved by UNSC, where a place-holder indicator 'proportion of the (adult) population who own land, by sex' figures as one of the 52 indicators. Furthermore, the EDGE (Evidence and Data for Gender Equality) initiative7 is conducting methodological work on standards for the collection of reliable sex disaggregated data on land ownership.","Reliability \nThe indicator is expected to be reliable because the identification of the plot owner(s)/individual with rights over land in household surveys is a feasible task. Household surveys are usually done on a sample basis and are statistically representative at national and subnational level. \nCoverage \nThe indicator is nationally representative insofar the survey data is nationally representative. The indicator can be collected periodically (about every 2-4 years) which is a reasonable frequency to capture significant changes in land ownership. \nIn most countries, national household surveys and agricultural surveys will be the main data sources for this indicator. \nAcknowledging the relevance of land rights for indigenous populations, countries should work towards: i) including indigenous people in the survey sample frames; ii) collecting information on ethnicity and using it as disaggregation variable for this indicator. Oversampling and questionnaire adaptation might be required to guarantee representativeness and ensure adequacy of concepts and language to the indigenous populations. To this extent, representatives of indigenous populations may consider developing their own data collection capacity according to the existing national standards, and accompanying the national statistical offices in the various data collection efforts. \nComparability across countries \nDifferent country definitions of ownership and rights over land can be problematic. Also, the indicator is collected in different years, depending on when surveys are conducted in individual countries. This can negatively affects comparability across countries. \nSub-national estimates \nIt is possible to disaggregate the indicator by geographic areas if the surveys are representative for these areas. The level of disaggregation depends on the sample design of the surveys.",We do not expect this indicator to change rapidly. It is worth highlighting that the baseline and follow-up values will be different across countries. To ensure correct comparisons linear interpolation between the actual data points will be necessary.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It provides a good indication of government's efforts to move towards the realization of women's land rights and more gender-equal land tenure.","The indicator exists. It is being collected through the analysis of the legal and policy framework as part of the Legislation Assessment Tool for gender-equitable land tenure (LAT) of the Gender and Land Rights Database. The indicator is not reported as such by the countries, but information can be extrapolated from the countries'national laws. The legal information is mainly accessible in FAO's FAOLEX a database that collects (http://faolex.fao.org/) legal material from the official gazettes, compiling texts of laws and regulations that are sent by FAO's Member Nations pursuant to Article XI of the FAO Constitution. The information is also available in as well as LandWise (Landesa). The indicator is disseminated through the FAO's Gender and Land Rights database (GLRD;http://www.fao.org/gender/landrights/home/en/) through its Legislation Assessment Tool (http://www.fao.org/gender-landrights-database/legislation-assessment-tool/en/). The indicator has been applied to 18 countries and the results are available on the LAT map of the GLRD. The complete LAT analysis can be expanded to 83 countries and validated by national legal experts with a total investment of US$450,000 partly funded by FAO. Results are comparable across countries; however, the indicator available in the GRLD only applies to the national legal framework and does not include regional legal frameworks.","Reliability \nWe expect this indicator to be accurate because it reflects the existence of legal measures to promote women's land rights and or productive resources.

'Good' indicates an ambient water quality that does not damage ecosystem function and human health according to core ambient water quality indicators. Concept: Water quality is estimated based on a core set of five determinands that inform on major water quality impairments present in many parts of the world: total dissolved solids (TDS); percentage dissolved oxygen (% DO); dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN); dissolved inorganic phosphorus (DIP); and Escherichia coli (E. coli). As monitoring capacities and coverage vary between countries, a monitoring ladder is proposed. On the first rung, the number of determinands not meeting national water quality guidelines based on the existing monitoring sites are used to estimate the water quality. On the second rung, a water quality index is used to combine the determinand values in a statistically more robust manner, and the monitoring coverage increased. On consecutive rungs, the monitoring coverage can be step-wise increased and complementary determinands covering additional aspects of ambient water quality can be included depending on the national capacities and requirements enabling the indicator to inform on the status of ambient water quality in a more comprehensive way.","The GEMS/Water1 water quality index approach is used as a general model to calculate the index, in which measured determinand values are compared to guideline values (proximity to target approach): \n\t1. Proximity-to-target (PTT) scores for each determinand at single monitoring sites are calculated as the difference between the temporal average (for the accounting period) of the determinand concentration and the target divided by the range between the (winsorized) minimum or maximum of the measured determinand concentration (for exceedance and non-exceedance targets, respectively) and the target. The PTT scores are scaled to the range between 0 and 100, where 100 indicates that the target is met and decreasing scores indicate an increasing distance from the target. \n\t2. The water quality index (WQI) at site level is computed as the arithmetic mean of the site-level PTT scores for the selected determinands. The WQI scale can be divided into different water quality categories, ranging from very bad to excellent. The thresholds for these categories are country specific and should be reported in the monitoring system by the individual countries \n\t3. For the spatial aggregation at the basin level and country level, the water bodies are divided into stretches of homogenous quality (between consecutive monitoring stations). \n\t4. The final indicator is calculated from the proportion of the stretches with good quality compared to all water bodies assessed.","The proposed indicator informs on the quality of water bodies. The indicator allows for evaluating the impact of human development on ambient water quality and thus enables countries to assess the future services they can obtain from aquatic ecosystems (clean water for drinking, biodiversity, water for food production etc.). Water quality represents the actual outcome of all pollution and pollution reduction activities, and is thus essential to fully describe the environmental status of freshwater systems, as well as to fully report on target 6.3. Water quality also feeds into all other water-related targets, and the proposed indicator can be used to directly report on many other targets or parts of targets (refer to supplementary information).",,,,,,,"Existing data (in situ and modelled values) are available from UNEP's GEMS/Water (GEMStat_) and OECD.

Agricultural value added in national currency is obtained from national statistics, converted to USD and deflated to the baseline year 2015. \nThe Cr coefficient can be estimated as Cr= 37%, on the basis of the general FAO assumption on the ratio between rainfed and irrigated yield. More detailed estimations are however possible and encouraged at country level. \nWater efficiency of industries is calculated as the industrial value added per unit of industrial (net) water withdrawn, and expressed in USD/m3. \nIn formula: Iwe = GVAiVi-Ri \nWhere: \n\tIwe = Irrigated water efficiency [USD/m3] \n\tGVAi = Gross value added by industry (excluding energy)[USD] \n\tVi =  Volume of water withdrawn by the industries (excluding energy) [m3] \n\tRi = Volume of water returned to the hydrologic system (return flow) [m3] \n\n Industrial water withdrawal (V) is collected at country level through national records and reported in questionnaires, in units of km3/year or million m3/year (see example in AQUASTAT http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/aq-5yr-quest_eng.xls). Industrial value added is obtained from national statistics, deflated to the baseline year 2015. Energy (power) water efficiency is calculated as the value added of power production per unit of (net) water withdrawn for energy production, and expressed in MWh/m3. \nIn formula: Ewe = TEPVe-Re \nWhere: \n\tEwe = Energy water efficiency [MWh/m3] \n\tTEP = Total energy production [MWh] \n\tVe =  Volume of water withdrawn for energy production, i.e. for the cooling of power plants (including evaporation from reservoirs created behind dams for hydropower) [m3] \n\tRe = Volume of water returned to the hydrologic system (return flow) [m3] \n\n Volume of water withdrawn for energy production (V) is collected at country level through national records and reported in questionnaires, in units of km3/year or million m3/year (see example in AQUASTAT http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/sets/aq-5yr-quest_eng.xls). Value added of electricity production is obtained from national statistics, deflated to the baseline year 2015. Municipal water supply efficiency is the ratio between water effectively distributed to the municipal users and the water withdrawn for municipal use by water supply utilities (i.e. distribution efficiency, size of network losses). \nIn formula: Mwe = MudVm \nWhere: \n\tMwe = Municipal water supply efficiency [-] \n\tMud = Water distributed to municipal users [m3] \n\tVm = Volume of water withdrawn by municipal utilities (i.e. the public distribution network) [m3] \nData on volumes of withdrawn and distributed are collected at country level from the municipal supply utilities records.","The rationale behind this indicator consists in providing information on the efficiency of the economic and social usage of water resources, i.e. output generated by the use of water in the different main sectors of the economy, and distribution network losses. Energy production has been disaggregated from the industrial sector due to its specific importance for the general development of a country. \nThe distribution efficiency of water systems is explicitly considered only for the municipal sector, but it is nonetheless implicit within the calculations also for the other sectors, and could be made explicit if needed and where data are available. \nThis indicator addresses specifically the target component 'substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors', by measuring the output per unit of water from productive uses of water as well as losses in municipal water use. It does not aim at giving an exhaustive picture of the water utilization in a country. Other indicators, specifically those for Targets 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 5.4, 5.a, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.5 will complement the information provided by this indicator. In particular, the indicator needs to be combined with the water stress indicator 6.4.2 to provide adequate follow-up of the target formulation. \nTogether, the four sectoral efficiencies provide a measure of overall efficiency in a country. The indicator provides incentives to improve water use efficiency through all sectors, highlighting those sectors where water use efficiency is lagging behind.",,,,,,,"The components of the indicator can be calculated using existing datasets and new data to be collected during country updates from FAO-AQUASTAT (FAO) on water withdrawals in different sectors (including new data on return flows), together with datasets on value generation from National Accounts Main Aggregates (UNSD), World Energy Outlook (International Energy Agency), UN Population Division demographic datasets, FAOSTAT, World Bank, WaterStat database (Water Footprint Network) and IBNET (the International Benchmarking Network for water and sanitation utilities). \nUNSD Environment Statistics Section collects data from official national sources for water abstraction by ISIC activity through its biennial UNSD/UNEP Water Questionnaire from non OECD/Eurostat countries. UNSD closely collaborates with FAO-AQUASTAT and shares and validates data to provide together the best possible data at the global level. Data for OECD and Eurostat countries are being collected through the OECD/Eurostat Questionnaire that is consistent with the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire, so data are comparable. Modelled data can be used to fill in possible gaps while capacity in data collection is being developed, so that the indicator can be calculated for all countries immediately.",,,"The indicator covers agricultural, industrial, energy and municipal sectors, so to provide the means for a more detailed analysis of the water use efficiency for national planning and decision-making. Although it would be difficult to disaggregate the indicator to hydrological basin or subnational scales, the calculations and methods provided as part of indicator development could be replicated by countries or water management organizations to provide similar data for sub-national or basin units, to be then aggregated to give the country-level indicator.","Entity responsible for global monitoring: FAO (through AQUASTAT), on behalf of UN-Water.

The estimation of the volumes of water withdrawn for energy production would be possible making several assumptions. Main sources of data for the gross value added by irrigated agriculture and industry are FAOSTAT and the World Bank database. Other sources include the World Energy Outlook of the International Energy Agency and the UNIDO database.","The corrective coefficient Cr for the agricultural sector is needed in order to focus the indicator on the irrigated production. This is done in order to eliminate a potential bias of the indicators, which otherwise would tend to decrease if rainfed cropland is converted to irrigated. Regional differences, in particular in relation to irrigated agriculture and different climatic conditions (including variability), are to be considered in the interpretation of this indicator, especially in countries with large amounts of available water resources. Also for this reason, coupling this indicator with water stress (6.4.2) is important for the interpretation of the data.","As the indicator components are not measured by gender, it is not possible to disaggregate this indicator by gender.

Main sectors, as defined by ISIC standards, can include for example agriculture; forestry and fishing; manufacturing; electricity industry; and municipalities. This indicator is also known as water withdrawal intensity. The indicator builds on MDG indicator 7.5 and also accounts for environmental water requirements.\n\nThis indicator provides an estimate of pressure by all sectors on the country's renewable freshwater resources. A low level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors is marginal in relation to the resources, and has therefore little potential impact on the sustainability of the resources or on the potential competition between users. A high level of water stress indicates a situation where the combined withdrawal by all sectors represents a substantial share of the total renewable freshwater resources, with potentially larger impacts on the sustainability of the resources and potential situations of conflicts and competition between users. \nTotal renewable freshwater resources (TRWR) are expressed as the sum of internal and external renewable water resources. The terms ""water resources"" and ""water withdrawal"" are understood here as freshwater resources and freshwater withdrawal. \nInternal renewable water resources are defined as the long-term average annual flow of rivers and recharge of groundwater for a given country generated from endogenous precipitation. \nExternal renewable water resources refer to the flows of water entering the country, taking into consideration the quantity of flows reserved to upstream and downstream countries through agreements or treaties (and, where available, the reduction of flow due to upstream withdrawal). \nTotal freshwater withdrawal (TWW) is the volume of freshwater extracted from its source (rivers, lakes, aquifers) for agriculture, industries and municipalities. It is estimated at the country level for the following three main sectors: agriculture, municipalities (including domestic water withdrawal) and industries. Freshwater withdrawal includes primary freshwater (not withdrawn before), secondary freshwater (previously withdrawn and returned to rivers and groundwater) and fossil groundwater. It does not include non-conventional water, i.e. direct use of treated wastewater, direct use of agricultural drainage water and desalinated water. TWW is in general calculated as being the sum of total water withdrawal by sector minus direct use of wastewater, direct use of agricultural drainage water and use of desalinated water. \nEnvironmental water requirements (Env.) are established in order to protect the basic environmental services of freshwater ecosystems. Methods of computation of Env. are extremely variable. For the purpose of the SDG indicator, Env. are expressed as a percentage of the available water resources. \nMore details on method of calculation of the above variables can be found at \nhttp://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/water_res/index.stm or \nhttp://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/data/wrs/readPdf.html?f=AFG-WRS_eng.pdf.","The indicator is computed as the total freshwater withdrawn (TWW) divided by the difference between the total renewable freshwater resources (TRWR) and the environmental water requirements (Env.), multiplied by 100. All variables are expressed in km3/year (10^9 m3/year). \n\n Stress (%) = ( TWW / TRWR - Env. ) * 100 \n\nIt is proposed to classify the level of water stress in three main categories (levels): low, high and very high. The thresholds for the indicator could be country specific, to reflect differences in climate and national water management objectives. Alternatively, uniform thresholds could be proposed using existing literature and taking into account environmental water requirements.","The purpose of this indicator is to show the degree to which water resources are being exploited to meet the country's water demand. It measures a country's pressure on its water resources and therefore the challenge on the sustainability of its water use. It tracks progress in regard to ""withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity"", i.e. the environmental component of target 6.4. \nThe indicator shows to what extent water resources are already used, and signals the importance of effective supply and demand management policies. It can also indicate the likelihood of increasing competition and conflict between different water uses and users in a situation of increasing water scarcity. Increased water stress, shown by an increase in the value of the indicator, has potentially negative effects on the sustainability of the natural resources and on economic development. On the other hand, low values of the indicator indicate that water does not represent a particular challenge for economic development and sustainability.",,,,,,,"Data for this indicator are usually collected by national ministries and institutions having waterrelated issues in their mandate, such as ministries of water resources, agriculture, or environment. Data are mainly published within national water resources and irrigation master plans, national statistical yearbooks and other reports (such as those from projects, international surveys or results and publications from national and international research centres).",,,"To compute this indicator, several sectoral data are needed. The indicator can be disaggregated to show the respective contribution of different sectors to the country's water stress, and therefore the relative importance of actions needed to contain water demand in the different sectors (agriculture, municipalities and industry). \nAt national level, water resources and withdrawal are estimated or measured at the level of appropriate hydrological units (river basins, aquifers). It is therefore possible to obtain a geographical distribution of water stress by hydrological unit, thus allowing for more targeted response in terms of water demand management.","FAO (through AQUASTAT), on behalf of UNWater. Under the UN-Water umbrella, a partial monitoring framework is already in place, currently being finalized under the inter-agency monitoring initiative known as GEMI (Integrated Monitoring of Water and Sanitation Related Targets). GEMI is a new coherent monitoring framework, working closely with JMP, to ensure long-term monitoring for the entire SDG 6. \nThe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is the agency responsible for compiling data and calculating this indicator at the international level. This is done through its Global Water Information System (AQUASTAT) country surveys since 1994. These surveys are carried out every ten years, on average. \nData are obtained through detailed questionnaires filled in by national experts and consultants who collect information from the different institutions and ministries having water-related issues in their mandate. Literature and information at the country and sub-country level are reviewed including national policies and strategies; water resources and irrigation master plans; national reports, yearbooks and statistics; reports from projects; international surveys; results and publications from national and international research centres; and the Internet. \nEnv. data are presently not systematically collected by AQUASTAT, but several methods are available and could be used to compute Env. for countries that do not have the institutional arrangements and standards in place to assess or collect these data. Data obtained from national sources are systematically reviewed to ensure consistency in definitions and consistency in data from countries located in the same river basin. A methodology has been developed and rules established to compute the different elements of national water balances. \nEstimates are based on country information, complemented, when necessary, with expert calculations based on unit water use figures by sector, and with available global datasets. In the case of conflicting sources of information, the difficulty lies in selecting the most reliable one. In some cases, water resources figures vary considerably from one source to another. There are various reasons for such differences, including differing computation methods, definitions or reference periods, double counting of surface water and groundwater or of transboundary river flows. Moreover, estimates of long-term average annual values can change due to the availability of better data from improvements in knowledge, methods or measurement networks. \nWhere several sources result in divergent or contradictory information, preference is given to information collected at the national or sub-national level rather than at regional or world levels. Moreover, except in the case of evident errors, official sources are privileged. As regards shared water resources, the comparison of information between countries makes it possible to verify and complete data concerning the flows of transboundary rivers and to ensure data coherence at the river basin level. In spite of these precautions, the accuracy, reliability and frequency with which information is collected vary considerably by region, country and category of information. Information is completed using models when necessary. \nRegional and global level aggregations are obtained by applying the same procedure as for country level computation. \nAQUASTAT data on water resources and use are published when new information becomes available on the FAO-AQUASTAT website at http://www.fao.org/nr/aquastat. \nModelled data are used with caution to fill gaps while capacity is being developed. Data on water resources can be modelled by using GIS-based hydrological models. Data on water withdrawal are estimated by sector on the basis of standard unit values of water withdrawal. \nUNSD Environment Statistics Section collects data from official national sources for water abstraction by ISIC activity through its biennial UNSD/UNEP Water Questionnaire from non OECD/Eurostat countries. UNSD closely collaborates with FAO-AQUASTAT and shares and validates data to provide together the best possible data at the global level. Data for OECD and Eurostat countries are being collected through the OECD/Eurostat Questionnaire that is consistent with the UNSD/UNEP Questionnaire, so data are comparable.","Water withdrawal as a percentage of water resources is a good indicator of pressure on limited water resources, one of the most important natural resources. However, it only partially addresses the issues related to sustainable water management. \nSupplementary indicators that capture the multiple dimensions of water management would combine data on water demand management, behavioural changes with regard to water use and the availability of appropriate infrastructure, and measure progress in increasing the efficiency and sustainability of water use, in particular in relation to population and economic growth. They would also recognize the different climatic environments that affect water use in countries, in particular in agriculture, which is the main user of water. Sustainability assessment is also linked to the critical thresholds fixed for this indicator and there is no universal consensus on such threshold. \nTrends in water withdrawal show relatively slow patterns of change. Usually, three-five years are a minimum frequency to be able to detect significant changes, as it is unlikely that the indicator would show meaningful variations from one year to the other. \nEstimation of water withdrawal by sector is the main limitation to the computation of the indicator. Few countries actually publish water use data on a regular basis by sector. \nRenewable water resources include all surface water and groundwater resources that are available on a yearly basis without consideration of the capacity to harvest and use this resource. Exploitable water resources, which refer to the volume of surface water or groundwater that is available with an occurrence of 90% of the time, are considerably less than renewable water resources, but no universal method exists to assess such exploitable water resources. \nThere is no universally agreed method for the computation of incoming freshwater flows originating outside of a country's borders. Nor is there any standard method to account for return flows, the part of the water withdrawn from its source and which flows back to the river system after use. In countries where return flow represents a substantial part of water withdrawal, the indicator tends to underestimate available water and therefore overestimate the level of water stress. \nOther limitations that affect the interpretation of the water stress indicator include: \n\tdifficulty to obtain accurate, complete and up-to-date data; \n\tpotentially large variation of sub-national data; \n\tlack of account of seasonal variations in water resources; \n\tlack of consideration to the distribution among water uses; \n\tlack of consideration of water quality and its suitability for use; and \n\tthe indicator can be higher than 100 per cent when water withdrawal includes secondary freshwater (water withdrawn previously and returned to the system), nonrenewable water (fossil groundwater), when annual groundwater withdrawal is higher than annual replenishment (over-abstraction) or when water withdrawal includes part or all of the water set aside for environmental water requirements. \nSome of these issues can be solved through disaggregation of the index at the level of hydrological units and by distinguishing between different use sectors. However, due to the complexity of water flows, both within a country and between countries, care should be taken not to double-count.","Women and men tend to have different water-related uses, priorities and responsibilities. There are also trends along gender lines in terms of access and control over water and water rights. Gender differences and inequalities mean that women and men experience and respond to changes in water availability, services or water policies differently. Thus the impact of water stress on women and men should be studied in order to better capture the gender dimension of water use.",,,,15.1,,,,,,,,GEMI,,UN-WATER,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regular meetings of the riparian countries to discuss IWRM and exchange of information are required for an arrangement to be defined as ""operational"".\nConcepts: Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) is an approach to managing water in a coordinated way. It takes into account the different water sources as well as various users and uses in a given situation, with the aim of maximizing positive social, economic and environmental benefits. It uses catchments and aquifers, as the principle unit of water management, and stresses decentralization of governance structures and active stakeholder participation in decision making. \nTransboundary basins are surface water or groundwater basins (aquifers) which cross or are located on boundaries between two or more States. \nAn agreement, institutional arrangement and/or an established organization provides a framework for cooperation on transboundary water management. Such a framework is commonly based on an agreement covering different aspects of transboundary water management. Agreements may be interstate, intergovernmental, interministerial or interagency. In addition to an agreement (e.g. a treaty, convention, Memorandum of Understanding), such framework can be provided by a bilateral or multilateral commission or other appropriate institutional arrangements for cooperation. Furthermore, multi-sectoral cooperation institutions can cover for water issues. For a cooperation framework to be considered as ""operational"", it requires that there are regular meetings of the riparian countries to discuss the integrated management of the water resource and to exchange information.","Calculated ' for any spatial unit (country, region) ' as the percentage that the total surface area (in km2) of transboundary basins that have an operational arrangement for water cooperation makes up of the total surface area of transboundary basins (km2). GIS data on the extent and location of transboundary basins facilitates the spatial analysis, corresponding datasets available globally.","Target 6.5 stresses the importance of transboundary cooperation to implement integrated water resources management of shared basins, to ensure availability and sustainable management of water resources. \nMost of the world's water resources are shared: transboundary lake and river basins cover nearly one half of the Earth's land surface and account for an estimated 60% of global freshwater. Approximately 40% of the world's population lives in transboundary river and lake basins and over 90% lives in countries that share basins. However, cooperation on shared water resources is in most cases not advanced. \nThe single most important factor enabling transboundary water cooperation is the existence of a cooperation framework (agreement, institution or other adequate arrangement) and it being operational, i.e. ensuring regular dialogue and exchange between riparian countries.",,,,,,,"Existing data and sources for this indicator include: \nSpatial data (delineating transboundary basins) are available for all known transboundary basins. Data are available at global level at the 120 international river basin organisations. Spatial data are available for all currently known 286 surface water basins and 592 transboundary aquifers. Associated uncertainties (i.e. delineation of transboundary aquifers) are being refined gradually. \nA global database of freshwater treaties and international river basin organizations exists as well as several regional ones, e.g., for the Pan-European region the second Assessment under the UNECE Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Water Convention) and for the Americas, compilations by UNESCO and the Organization for American States. Further detailed information on cooperation for different types of transboundary waters (rivers, lakes and groundwaters) is expected to become available through a regular reporting mechanism on transboundary water cooperation, established under the UNECE Water Convention in November 2015 by a decision of the Meeting of the Parties to this Convention opened for accession by all UN Member States. \nA global baseline comparative assessment of transboundary waters, including river basins and aquifers has been undertaken by the Transboundary Waters Assessment Project (TWAP, completed in 2014), involving generation of geo-referenced datasets, including on transboundary cooperation.

Originally designed as an agreement for the pan-European region, the Convention was amended to open it for accession to all UN Member States. The amendments entered into force in February 2013. The regular reporting on transboundary water cooperation adopted by the Meeting of the Parties to the Convention in November 2015 includes questions by transboundary basins, rivers, lakes and aquifers (as appropriate) about existence, scope and features of agreements and arrangements for transboundary water cooperation. Both Parties and non-Parties are invited to report. UNECE acts as secretariat for the Convention. \nIn the framework of the UNESCO Internationally Shared Aquifer Resources Management (ISARM) Initiative a world inventory of transboundary aquifers has been compiled since 2002, involving work on delineation and analysis of transboundary aquifer systems. The ISARM network consists of five regional networks of experts. Spatial data (delineating transboundary basins) are available for all knowntransboundary river basins and groundwaters UNESCO's Global Groundwater Information System (GGIS) is a web-based portal to groundwater-related information and knowledge. It includes spatial data for most currently known 592 transboundary aquifers. \nCountries have information about which basins are covered by operational arrangements for transboundary water cooperation, and what is the corresponding area share though uncertainties for groundwaters exist.","In line with the target, the indicator measures (and provides an incentive for) extending cooperation in transboundary basins. Without an adequate coordination at the basin level water resources management cannot be truly integrating the different water uses and ensure sustainability. Transboundary cooperation frameworks are highly diverse, differing in quality and effectiveness. At the same time, depending on the level of economic activities and the degree of development, and hence the coordination need, also vary. The monitoring can be based on general principles of cooperation. \nEventually, the scope, quality and/or extent of application of operational arrangements for transboundary cooperation could be reviewed for refining the monitoring. \nA part of the operational arrangements for integrated management of transboundary basin areas in place cover both surface waters and groundwaters but this is not always the case. The calculation should also take into account the present arrangements that are specific for groundwaters. \nThe information is expected to get gradually refined, notably on the delineations and consequently on the spatial extent of the aquifers as well as their exact number.","Gender equity and women's empowerment in water resources management is one of the cornerstones of the Dublin-Rio principles.

In many parts of the world, the presence of an electricity connection in the household does not necessarily guarantee that the energy supplied is adequate in quality and reliability or affordable in cost and it would be desirable to have fuller information about these critical attributes of the service, which have been highlighted in SDG7. \nSubstantial progress has already been made toward developing and piloting a new methodology known as the Multi-Tier Framework for Measuring Energy Access (World Bank) which is able to capture these broader dimensions of service quality and would make it possible to go beyond a simple yes/no measure of energy access to a more refined approach that recognizes different levels of energy access, and also takes into account the affordability and reliability of energy access explicitly referenced in the language of SDG7. The methodology for the Multi-Tier Framework for Measuring Energy Access has already been published based on a broad consultative exercise and represents a consensus view across numerous international agencies working in the field. A first Global Energy Access Survey using this methodology has already been launched and is underway expecting to yield results by early 2017. Discussions are also progressing with the World Bank's Household Survey Technical Working Group regarding the mainstreaming of this methodology into the standardized household questionnaire design that will be applied every three years in all low income countries between 2015 and 2030 as part of the broader SDG monitoring exercise. \nThe adoption of this methodology will allow ' over time ' the more refined measurement of energy access, making it possible to report more disaggregated information regarding the type of electricity supply (grid or off-grid), the capacity of electricity supply provided (in Watts), the duration of service (daily hours and evening hours), the reliability of service (in terms of number and length of unplanned service interruptions), the quality of service (in terms of voltage fluctuations), as well as affordability and legality of service. \nAnother advantage of this approach is that they can be applied not only to measuring energy access at the household level, but also its availability to support enterprises and deliver critical community services, such as health and education. \nMethodological challenges associated with the measurement of energy access are more fully described the Global Tracking Framework (2013) (Chapter 2, Section 1, page 75-82), and in the ESMAP (2015) Report ""Beyond Connections: Energy Access Redefined"" both of which are referenced below.","Energy is a service provided at the household, rather than individual level.

This single measure captures a good part of the lack of access to clean cooking fuels, but fails to collect data on type of device or technology is used for cooking, and also fails to capture other polluting forms of energy use in the home such as those used for lighting and heating. \nNew evidence-based normative guidance from the WHO ( i.e. WHO Guidelines for indoor air quality guidelines: household fuel combustion), highlights the importance of addressing both fuel and the technology for adequately protecting public health. These guidelines provide technical recommendations in the form of emissions targets for as to what fuels and technology (stove, lamp, and so on) combinations in the home are clean. These guidelines also recommend against the use of unprocessed coal and discourage the use kerosene (a non-solid but highly polluting fuel) in the home. They also recommend that all major household energy end uses (e.g. cooking, space heating, lighting) use efficient fuels and technology combinations to ensure health benefits. \nFor this reason, the technical recommendations in the WHO guidelines, access to modern cooking solution in the home will be defined as ""access to clean fuels and technologies"" rather than ""access to non-solid fuels."" This shift will help ensure that health and other ""nexus"" benefits are better counted, and thus realized. \nDefinition \nPercent of population with primary reliance on clean* fuels and technologies at the household level. \n*""Clean"" is defined by the emission rate targets and specific fuel recommendations (i.e. against unprocessed coal and kerosene) included in the normative guidance WHO guidelines for indoor air quality: household fuel combustion.","The indicator is calculated as the number of people using clean fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting divided by total population reporting that any cooking, heating or lighting, expressed as percentage. \n\n Method of computation \nThe indicator is modelled with household survey data compiled by WHO. The information on cooking fuel use and cooking practices comes from about 800 nationally representative survey and censuses. Survey sources include Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Living Standards Measurement Surveys (LSMS), Multi-Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS), the World Health Survey (WHS), and other nationally developed and implemented surveys. \nEstimates of primary cooking energy for the total, urban and rural population for a given year are obtained separately using a multilevel model. The model only accounts for regions, countries and time as a spline function, and estimates are restricted to values ranging from zero to one. More details on the model are published elsewhere (Bonjour et al, 2013). \nEstimates for countries with no available surveys were obtained as follows: \n\tWhen survey data is available for a country, the regional populationweighted mean is used to derive aggregate estimates at a regional or global level, however no country point estimate is given for that country is reported \n\tCountries classified as high-income with a Gross National Income (GNI) of more than US$ 12,746.- per capita are assumed to have made a complete transition to using clean fuels and technologies as the primary domestic energy source for cooking and the primary reliance on polluting (unclean) fuels and technologies use is reported to be less than 5% and assumed as zero for regional and global estimates. \nFor estimating the fraction of the population relying on clean fuels and technologies for heating and lighting, the same methodology using survey data to derive country estimates for a particular year will be used using the same above mentioned assumptions.","Primary reliance on clean fuels and technologies\n Cooking, lighting and heating represent a large share of household energy use across the low- and middle-income countries. For cooking and heating, households typically rely on solid fuels (such as wood, charcoal, biomass) or kerosene paired with inefficient technologies (e.g. open fires, stoves, space heaters or lamps). It is well known that reliance on such inefficient energy for cooking, heating and lighting is associated with high levels of household (indoor) air pollution. The use of inefficient fuels for cooking alone is estimated to cause over 4 million deaths annually, mainly among women and children. This is more than TB, HIV and malaria combined. These adverse health impacts can be avoided by adopting clean fuels and technologies for all main household energy end-or in some circumstances by adopting advanced combustion cook stoves (i.e. those which achieve the emission rates targets provided by the WHO guidelines) and adopting strict protocols for their safe use. Given the importance of clean and safe household energy use as a human development issue, universal access to energy among the technical practitioner community is currently taken to mean access to both electricity and clean fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting. For this reason, clean cooking forms part of the universal access objective under the UN Secretary General's Sustainable Energy for All initiative.",,,,,,,"Access to clean fuels and technologies \nPrimary household fuels and technologies, particularly for cooking, is routinely collected at the national levels in most countries using censuses and surveys. Household surveys used include: United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-supported Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS); United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)-supported Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS); WHO-supported World Health Surveys (WHS); and other reliable and nationally representative country surveys. The World Health Organization is the agency that has taken responsibility for compiling a database of statistics on access to clean and polluting fuels and technologies harvested from the full global body of household surveys for cooking, heating and lighting. Currently, the WHO Database covers cooking energy for 157 countries and one territory for the period 1970-2015 and is updated regularly and publicly available. For lighting, the WHO database includes data for 76 countries for the period 1963-2014. For heating, the WHO database includes data for 16 countries for the period 1986 ' 2012. Presently WHO is working with national surveying agencies, country statistical offices and other stakeholders (e.g. researchers) to enhance multipurpose household survey instruments to gather data on the fuels and technologies used for heating and lighting.",,,"Disaggregated estimates for different end-uses (i.e. cooking, heating* and lighting*).

The Sustainable Energy for All Global Tracking Framework reports clean cooking fuel and technology access rates based on WHO data every two years.,"Access to non-solid fuels\n The indicator uses the type of primary fuels and technologies used for cooking, heating, and lighting as a practical surrogate for estimating human exposure to household (indoor) air pollution and its related disease burden, as it is not currently possible to obtain nationally representative samples of indoor concentrations of criteria pollutants, such as fine particulate matter and carbon monoxide. However epidemiological studies provide a science-based evidence for establishing those estimates using these surrogates. \nThe indicator is based on the main type of fuel and technology used for cooking as cooking occupies the largest share of overall household energy needs. However, many households use more than one type of fuel and stove for cooking and, depending on climatic and geographical conditions, heating with polluting fuels can also be a contributor to household (indoor) air pollution levels. In addition, lighting with kerosene, a very polluting and hazardous fuel is also often used, and in some countries is the main fuel used for cooking. \nWhile the existing global household survey evidence base provides a good starting point for tracking household energy access for cooking fuel, it also presents a number of limitations that will need to be addressed over time. Currently there is a limited amount of available data capturing the type of fuel and devices used in the home for heating and lighting. Accordingly WHO in cooperation with World Bank, and the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves, is leading a survey enhancement process with representatives from country statistical offices and national household surveying agencies (e.g. DHS, MICS, LSMS) to better gather efficiently and harmoniously information on the fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting. This process is currently in the piloting phase with expected rollout of the final household surveys questions (~6 questions in total) expected in the coming year. These few questions will replace and slightly expand the current set of questions commonly used on national multipurpose surveys to assess household energy. \nSubstantial progress has already been made toward developing and piloting a new methodology known as the Multi-Tier Framework for Measuring Energy Access (World Bank) which is able to capture the affordability and reliability of energy access explicitly referenced in the language of SDG7 and harnesses the normative guidance in the WHO guidelines to benchmark tiers of energy access.

It is calculated by dividing consumption of energy from all renewable sources by total final energy consumption. Renewable energy consumption includes consumption from: hydro, solid biofuels, wind, solar, liquid biofuels, biogas, geothermal, marine and waste. Total final consumption of energy is calculated from national balances and statistics as total final consumption minus non-energy use. \nRenewable energy consumption is derived from three tables of the IEA world energy statistics and balances: total final consumption, electricity output and heat output. All volumes reported in the total final consumption table are taken as reported. Since volumes for electricity and heat in the final consumption table are not broken down by technology, electricity and heat output tables are used instead to break down final consumption of electricity and heat by technology. The allocation by technology is done by deriving the share of technology in electricity and heat output tables and multiplying that share by final energy consumption of electricity and heat, respectively. For instance, if total final consumption table reports 150 TJ for waste energy, while total final consumption of electricity is 400 TJ and heat 100 TJ, and the share of waste in total electricity output is 10 percent and 5 percent in heat, the total reported number for waste consumption will be 195 TJ (150 TJ+400TJ*10%+100TJ*5%).

These include solar, wind, ocean, hydropower, geothermal resources, and bioenergy (in the case of bioenergy, which can be depleted, sources of bioenergy can be replaced within a short to medium-term frame). Importantly, this indicator focuses on the amount of renewable energy actually consumed rather than the capacity for renewable energy production, which cannot always be fully utilized. By focusing on consumption by the end user, it avoids the distortions caused by the fact that conventional energy sources are subject to significant energy losses along the production chain.",,,,,,,"Data on renewable energy consumption are available through national Energy Balances produced by the International Energy Agency and UN Statistics for more than 180 countries.

For example, a substantial share of today's renewable energy consumption comes from the use of wood and charcoal by households in the developing world, which sometimes may be associated with unsustainable forestry practices. There are efforts underway to improve the ability to measure the sustainability of bio-energy, although this remains a significant challenge. \n\tOff-grid renewables data is limited and not sufficiently captured in the national accounts \n\tThe method of allocation of renewable energy consumption from electricity and heat output assumes that the share of transmission and distribution losses are the same between all technologies. However, this is not always true because renewables are usually located in more remote areas from consumption centers and may incur larger losses. \n\tDividing solid biofuels for traditional and modern uses by applying the residential sector use in non- OECD countries is an imperfect measure, yet it is the best approximation possible with the current state of data availability. \n\tMethodological challenges associated with defining and measuring renewable energy are more fully described the Global Tracking Framework (2013) Chapter 4, Section 1, page 194-200.",,,"Since 2012, under the auspices of Sustainable Energy for All, the World Bank and the International Energy Agency worked on the development of the SE4ALL Global Tracking Framework in close collaboration with a consortium of 24 international agencies (Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves (GACC), Global Water Partnership (GWP), International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), International Network on Gender and Sustainable Energy (Energia), International Partnership for Energy Efficiency Cooperation (IPEEC), International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Practical Action, Renewable Energy Network for the 21st Century (REN21), Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI), UN Energy, United Nations Development Program (UNDP), United Nations Foundation (UNF), United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA), United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), UN Statistics, World Energy Council (WEC) and the World Health Organization (WHO)).

However, there is no consensus on a methodology for doing this in a standardized way, compromising international comparability, although UNWTO is working on this (through the INRouTe project).

Where population information is available, sample selection is based on probabilities proportional to population size; otherwise, simple random sampling is used. Random route procedures are used to select sampled households. Unless an outright refusal occurs, interviewers make up to three attempts to survey the sampled household. To increase the probability of contact and completion, attempts are made at different times of the day and, where possible, on different days. If an interview cannot be obtained at the initial sampled household, a simple substitution method is used. Respondents are randomly selected within the selected households by means of the Kish grid. In economies where cultural restrictions dictate gender matching, respondents are randomly selected through the Kish grid from among all eligible adults of the interviewer's gender. \nIn economies where telephone interviewing is em-ployed, random digit dialing or a nationally representative list of phone numbers is used.

Moreover, data is not harmonized and comparable at the world level. \n\t\tTo obtain this data will require collecting it at municipal/city level with serious deficiencies in some areas such as data on mass transit and on transport infrastructure. \n\tThe European Commission, on the contrary, considers that 'this is a good indicator which can be collected in a relatively straightforward way' (DG REGIO, 2015). The assessment of the indicator done by the EC applies only for cities in the developed world, and not all. \n\tThe EC document highlights that the indicator was calculated for 80 European cities and stresses that the estimation requires the following data availability: (1) geo-coded public transport stops and the number of departures at each stop, (2) a high resolution GIS layer with population (for example census enumeration areas or a population grid) and (3) a street network (if available). \n\tHowever, these data requirements are not available in most middle income countries.\n\tUN-Habitat disagrees with this rating. This is a very relevant indicator. It is empirically proven that public transport makes cities more inclusive, safe and sustainable. \n\tEffective and low-cost transportation for mobility is critical for urban poverty and inequalities reduction, and economic development because it provides access to jobs, health care, education services and other public goods. \n\tClean Public transport is very efficient for the reduction of C02 emissions and therefore it contributes to climate change.",,,,,,,,,,"Information can be disaggregated by age and sex, including potential disadvantages such as disability, but it requires strong efforts and changes in mainstream mechanisms of data collection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It includes people who are presumed dead although there is no physical evidence. The data on number of deaths and number of missing are mutually exclusive. \nAffected people: People who are affected by a hazardous event. Comment: People can be affected directly or indirectly. Affected people may experience short-term or long-term consequences to their lives, livelihoods or health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets. \nDirectly affected: People who have suffered injury, illness or other health effects; who were evacuated, displaced, relocated; or have suffered direct damage to their livelihoods, economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets. \nIndirectly affected: People who have suffered consequences, other than or in addition to direct effects, over time due to disruption or changes in economy, critical infrastructures, basic services, commerce, work or social, health and physiological consequences. In this indicator, given the difficulties in assessing the full range of all affected (directly and indirectly), UNISDR proposes the use of an indicator that would estimate ""directly affected"" as a proxy for the number of affected. This indicator, while not perfect, comes from data widely available and could be used consistently across countries and over time to measure the achievement of the Target B. From the perspective of data availability and measurability, it is proposed to build a composite indicator which consists of ""directly affected"", or those who are \n\tInjured or ill, \n\tEvacuated, \n\tRelocated and to measure the number who suffered direct damage to their livelihoods or assets, \n\tPeople whose houses were damaged or destroyed \n\tPeople who received food relief aid. \nInjured or ill: The number of people suffering from physical injuries, trauma or cases of disease requiring immediate medical assistance as a direct result of a hazardous event. \nEvacuated: The number of people who temporarily moved from where they were (including their place of residence, work places, schools and hospitals) to safer locations in order to ensure their safety. \nRelocated: The number of people who moved permanently from their homes to new sites due to hazardous event. Note: This definition excludes preventive relocation before the event. \nPeople whose houses were damaged or destroyed due to hazardous events: The estimated number of inhabitants previously living in the houses (housing units) damaged or destroyed. All the inhabitants of these houses (housing units) are assumed to be affected being in their dwelling or by direct consequence of the destruction/damage to their housings (housing units). An average number of inhabitants per house (housing unit) in the country can be used to estimate the value. \nHouses destroyed: Houses (housing units) levelled, buried, collapsed, washed away or damaged to the extent that they are no longer habitable. \nHouses damaged: Houses (housing units) with minor damage, not structural or architectural, which may continue to be habitable, although they may require some repair or cleaning. \nPeople who received food relief aid: The number of persons who received food /nutrition, by government or as humanitarian aid, during or in the aftermath of a hazardous event. \nHazardous event: The occurrence of a natural or human-induced phenomenon in a particular place during a particular period of time due to the existence of a hazard. \nHazard: A potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon or human activity that may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. UNISDR recommends setting NO threshold for recording hazardous event in order to monitor all hazardous events. Small-scale but frequent hazardous events that are not registered in international disaster loss databases account for an important share of damages and losses when they are combined, and often go unnoticed by the national and international community. These events, when accumulated, are often a source of poverty in developing countries but can be effectively addressed by well-designed policies. The scope of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 is ""the risk of small-scale and large-scale, frequent and infrequent, sudden and slow-onset disasters, caused by natural or man-made hazards as well as relate environmental, technological and biological hazards and risks"". Regarding the inclusion of biological and environmental hazards in natural hazards category and whether and how to integrate man-made hazards, UNISDR will discuss the issue with WHO and other organizations (for example, WHO would be in a better position in terms of data, knowledge and relationship with Member States and other stakeholders to monitor biological events including epidemics. However, we generally do not expect biological disasters will cause physical damages to facilities. ). Note: Terminology will be discussed and finalized in the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group for Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.","Summation of data on related indicators from national disaster loss databases. Make the sum a relative figure by using global population data (World Bank or UN Statistics information). Relativity is important because population growth (expected to be 9 billion in 2050) may translate into increased hazard exposure of population. The Expert Group recommends not using the indicators related with the people whose houses were damaged/destroyed in the computation. UNISDR and IRDR groups recommend using them as they can be estimated from widely available and verifiable data and reflect vulnerability and livelihood issues. Data on housing damage and destroyed is essential for economic loss, so using these indicators would not impose additional data collection burden. \nDouble-counting: From practical perspective, double counting of affected people is unavoidable (for example, injured and relocated) in many countries. Minimum double counting is summing 'number of injured' and Number of people whose housings were damaged or destroyed. Relocated is sub-set of number of people whose housings were destroyed. \nThe data can be disaggregated by hazard type. When applied to proposed target 13.1 and 15.3, hydrological, meteorological and climatological and indirectly biological disasters are monitored.","Cities around the world, as well as rural populations, witness growing disaster risks. Impacts of climate change on sustainable development are observed through both slow-onset events (e.g. sea level rise, increasing temperatures, ocean acidification, glacial retreat and related impacts, salinization, land and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity and desertification) and extreme weather events. Human loss can be measured by the number of deaths, missing, injured or ill, evacuated, relocated, people whose houses were damaged/destroyed and people who received food relief aid as a direct result of the hazardous events. \nCities are some of the most vulnerable areas to natural disasters. Unplanned urban development (e.g. informal settlements, overcrowding, inadequate infrastructures) exacerbates urban vulnerability to climate change impacts and hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. Over half of all coastal areas are urbanized and 21 of the world's 33 mega cities lie in coastal flood zones. SIDS and coastal regions are particularly affected by sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion, and extreme events (e.g. tsunamis and storm surges) due to undermining natural protective barriers, low levels of development combined with rapid population growth in low lying coastal areas and inadequate capacity to adapt. Poor urban populations must often resort to unsustainable coping strategies and mechanisms. \nLarge numbers of people remain perilously close to falling into poverty, experiencing shocks that they are unable to cope with. For the poor, a shock of even a relatively short duration can have long term consequences. Several dimensions of poverty are closely related to environment, which is often affected by natural disasters. The poverty reduction agenda could include well-designed social protection scheme to help protecting the poor against sudden shocks and the development of capacities to better predict and prepare for such shocks. Better management of natural resources can themselves strengthen the resilience of the poor, by both reducing the likelihood of natural hazardous events and offering resources to help cope with them. Biodiversity provides ecosystem resilience and contributes to the ability to respond to unpredictable global changes and natural disasters. Healthy ecosystems act as buffers against natural hazards, providing valuable yet underutilized approaches for climate change adaptation, enhancing natural resilience and reducing the vulnerability of people, for example to floods and the effects of land degradation. These ecosystem services improve the sustainability and economic efficiency of built infrastructure, and are critical for sustainable and resilient urban areas. \nThis indicator will track human-related loss. The disaster loss data (particularly mortality) are significantly influenced by large-scale catastrophic event, which represent important outliers. UNISDR recommends countries to report the data by event, so complementary analysis can be done by both including and excluding such catastrophic events. \nThe indicator will build bridge between SDGs and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction because the reduction of human related loss is included in the Sendai Framework global targets and will also be monitored under the Sendai Framework Monitoring Mechanism. \n(mainly based on TST Issue Brief 2, 5, 20 and 23-26)",,,,,,,"National disaster loss database, reported to UNISDR",,,"By country, by event, by hazard type (e.g. disaggregation by climatological, hydrological, meteorological, geophysical, biological and extra-terrestrial for natural hazards is possible following IRDR* classification), by death/missing/injured or ill/evacuated/relocated/people whose houses were damaged/people whose houses were destroyed/people who received food relief aid. \n\t*Integrated Research on Disaster Risk (2014), Peril Classification and Hazard Glossary (IRDR DATA Publication No.1), Beijing: Integrated Research on Disaster Risk \nAdditionally, the Expert Group recommended disaggregation by age, sex, location of residence and other characteristics (e.g. disability) as relevant and possible.

The scope of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 is ""the risk of small-scale and large-scale, frequent and infrequent, sudden and slow-onset disasters, caused by natural or man-made hazards as well as relate environmental, technological and biological hazards and risks"". \nRegarding the inclusion of biological and environmental hazards in natural hazards category and whether and how to integrate man-made hazards, UNISDR will discuss the issue with WHO and other organizations (for example, WHO would be in a better position in terms of data, knowledge and relationship with Member States and other stakeholders to monitor biological events including epidemics. However, we generally do not expect biological disasters will cause physical damages to facilities. ). \n\tNote: Terminology will be discussed and finalized in the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group for Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.","The original national disaster loss databases usually register physical damage value (housing unit loss, infrastructure loss etc.). Need conversion from physical value to monetary value according to the UNISDR methodology. After converted, divide global direct economic loss by global GDP (inflation adjusted, constant USD) calculated from World Bank Development Indicators.","Cities around the world, as well as rural populations, witness growing disaster risks. Impacts of climate change on sustainable development are observed through both slow-onset events (e.g. sea level rise, increasing temperatures, ocean acidification, glacial retreat and related impacts, salinization, land and forest degradation, loss of biodiversity and desertification) and extreme weather events. The economic loss indicator would track loss to agricultural, industrial and commercial sectors and damage to housing and critical infrastructure. \nCities are some of the most vulnerable areas to natural disasters. Unplanned urban development (e.g. informal settlements, overcrowding, inadequate infrastructures) exacerbates urban vulnerability to climate change impacts and hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. Over half of all coastal areas are urbanized and 21 of the world's 33 mega cities lie in coastal flood zones. SIDS and coastal regions are particularly affected by sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion, and extreme events (e.g. tsunamis and storm surges) due to undermining natural protective barriers, low levels of development combined with rapid population growth in low lying coastal areas and inadequate capacity to adapt. Poor urban populations must often resort to unsustainable coping strategies and mechanisms. \nLarge numbers of people remain perilously close to falling into poverty, experiencing shocks that they are unable to cope with. For the poor, a shock of even a relatively short duration can have long term consequences. Several dimensions of poverty are closely related to environment, which is often affected by natural disasters. The poverty reduction agenda could include well-designed social protection scheme to help protecting the poor against sudden shocks and the development of capacities to better predict and prepare for such shocks. Better management of natural resources can themselves strengthen the resilience of the poor, by both reducing the likelihood of natural hazardous events and offering resources to help cope with them. \nThe environment for food production is increasingly challenging, particularly for smallholders, due to environmental and climate-related factors. Similar to extreme income poverty, food insecurity continues to be predominantly concentrated in rural areas of developing countries, and disproportionately affects poor farmers, agricultural workers, pastoralists and rural communities. Common conditions for protracted crisis situations include frequent or continued exposure to shocks that undermine livelihoods, food and market systems. Special consideration needs to be given to population living in areas prone to environmental and natural disaster shocks. \nBiodiversity provides ecosystem resilience and contributes to the ability to respond to unpredictable global changes and natural disasters. Healthy ecosystems act as buffers against natural hazards, providing valuable yet underutilized approaches for climate change adaptation, enhancing natural resilience and reducing the vulnerability of people, for example to floods and the effects of land degradation. These ecosystem services improve the sustainability and economic efficiency of built infrastructure, and are critical for sustainable and resilient urban areas. \nThis indicator will track direct physical loss expressed in economic term. The disaster loss data (particularly mortality) are significantly influenced by large-scale catastrophic event, which represent important outliers. UNISDR recommends countries to report the data by event, so complementary analysis can be done by both including and excluding such catastrophic events. \nThe indicator will build bridge between SDGs and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction because the reduction of direct economic loss is included in the Sendai Framework global targets and will also be monitored under the Sendai Framework Monitoring Mechanism. \n(mainly based on TST Issue Brief 2, 3, 5, 20 and 23-26)",,,,,,,"National disaster loss database, reported to UNISDR",,,"By country, by event, by hazard type (e.g. disaggregation by climatological, hydrological, meteorological, geophysical, biological and extra-terrestrial for natural hazards is possible following IRDR* classification), by asset loss category. \n\t*Integrated Research on Disaster Risk (2014), Peril Classification and Hazard Glossary (IRDR DATA Publication No.1), Beijing: Integrated Research on Disaster Risk \nIdeally, in addition, by sub-national administrative unit.",Summation of data from national disaster loss databases and World Bank Development Indicators,"This is proposal by UNISDR based on our experience and knowledge built in the period under the Hyogo Framework for Action (2005-2015).

The suggested indicator is currently under review by the Member States and UNISDR is receiving written inputs from the Member States. \nThe proposed indicators will be also used to monitor Sendai Framework global targets and therefore the detailed definitions shall be discussed and agreed in Open-ended Intergovernmental Expert Working Group on Indicators and Terminology on Disaster Risk Reduction, as outlined in Sendai Framework for Disaster Reduction 2015-2030. The Working Group is likely to finalize the discussion and submit the final report to the GA in December 2016. \nNot every country has a comparable national disaster loss database that is consistent with the UNISDR guidelines (current coverage is 85 countries.

WHO air quality guidelines provide specific recommendations on the mean levels of fine particulate matter which can support measuring the per capita health impacts related to any improvements or degradation in air quality in cities. Incidents of high air pollution levels also have health impacts, but these are less important than longer term exposures, and related statistics are less reliable in view of greater variability due to external factors, we therefore do recommend a more specific articulation of this indicator to as annual means as a way to monitor SDG achievement. \nFine particulate matter: Fine particulate matter (i.e. PM2.5) can be directly linked to estimates of health risks. Coarse particulate matter (i.e. PM10) measurements can be converted to PM2.5, but will inherently introduce additional uncertainty to estimates of impacts (e.g. health). Articulating this indicator to fine particulate matter increases its specificity and its relevance for monitoring the health impacts of sustainable development policies. \nPopulation weighted: The population size of cities vary within a country. Weighting annual mean air quality measurements of fine PM by the city population size relative to other cities in a country increases the suitability and measurability of this indicator at a national scale. Furthermore it makes estimating the related impacts on health and other sustainable development issues (e.g. improvements in energy efficiency from sustainable transport) more feasbile and accurate for monitoring progress.",,,,,,,"WHO Ambient Air Pollution in Cities Database: As part of its core functions, WHO monitors and assesses trends in major health risk factors including ambient air pollution. The WHO's Ambient air pollution database provides annual mean concentrations of particulate matter based on daily air measurements of particulate matter (PM10 or PM2.5) or data which could be aggregated into annual means. In a few exceptional cases, where annual means could not be calculated, measurements covering a more limited part of the year were used. \nThe primary source of data are official national/sub-national reports, national/sub-national web sites containing measurements of PM10 or PM2.5and the relevant national agencies. Furthermore, measurements reported by the following regional networks are used: the Asian Clean Air Initiative for Asia, and Airbase for Europe. In the absence of data from the previous sources, data from (a) UN Agencies, (b) Development agencies and (c) articles from peer reviewed journals are used. \nIn order to present air quality that is largely representative for human exposure, only measurements characterized as urban background, residential areas, commercial and mixed areas are used. Stations characterized as particular ""hot spots"" or exclusively industrial areas were excluded, unless they were contained in reported city means and could not be dissociated. \nCurrently the WHO database houses data from over 1,600 cities, from 91 countries for the years 2008 to 2013 inclusive (Figures 1 and 2). \nThis database is updated on a regular basis can be released annually to support monitoring of this SDG target. \n WHO Global Health Observatory: The WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) houses information on both the exposure (i.e. ambient air quality measurements of fine particulate matter) and associated disease burden. In addition, the GHO provides graphs, tables and interactive tools to depict air pollution levels across regions and countries which can support countries in visualizing their situation and in monitoring progress towards SDG11 more readily. \nWHO air quality guidelines: global update 2005: WHO air quality guidelines provide normative guidance on pollutant levels that can be considered ""healthy"". They also provide information about the sources of air pollution and the health impacts from exposure to different pollutants which serve as an important information resource for countries as they develop and implement plans for sustainable development. The recommendations of specific pollutant levels found in the guidelines serve as the basis for estimating the attributable disease burden to ambient air pollution. These guidelines are updated regularly and publicly available. \nData gaps & opportunities to address such gaps Several gaps in the currently available data for monitoring target 11.7 along with some recommendations of upcoming opportunities for filling such gaps are provided below. \nMeasurements of fine particulate matter: PM2.5 measurements can directly be linked to estimates of health risks using an integrated exposure response function, and are therefore of particular interest. PM10 measurements first need to be converted to PM2.5 in order to do. In high-income countries, PM2.5 measurements are already being widely performed. In low- and middle-income countries, however, while PM2.5 measures are increasingly being developed, they are not yet available in many countries. In low-and middle-income countries, annual mean PM2.5 measurements could be accessed in 69 cities, but PM10 in 512 cities. In high-income countries, 816 cities with PM2.5 measures could be accessed, against 544 cities with PM10 measurements. \nFor cities with PM10 reported as the only monitored PM parameter, PM2.5 concentration can be calculated from PM10 using national conversion factors (PM2.5/PM10 ratio) estimated as population-weighted averages of city-specific conversion factors for the country. City specific conversion factors were estimated as the mean ratio of PM2.5 to PM10 of stations for the same year, and alternatively as the ratio of city values if the values by station were not provided. If national conversion factors are not available, regional ones can be used, which are obtained by averaging country-specific conversion factors. \nDefinition of cities: There is no agreed upon definition of city and/or urban area. Currently the WHO Ambient air pollution database includes information on cities with populations of 100,000 or more. This is partly due to the fact that for some countries ambient air quality information is only available for larger cities whereas for other countries date is available for cities with just a few thousand inhabitants. In general, the inclusion of cities with less than 100,000 inhabitants did usually not significantly modify the country mean as compared to considering only cities larger than 100,000 inhabitants. WHO is able to update its database and reporting to include cities/urban areas to be in line with the definition agreed upon for the monitoring and tracking of SDG 11 on cities. \nGeographic coverage of monitoring: Measurement of ambient air quality in cities is currently limited to 91 countries. Below is a map of the current sources of ambient air quality monitoring housed in the WHO's Ambient air quality database (Figure 3). Although, as noted, there is a paucity of data from low- and middle-income countries, the level of monitoring and reporting in these areas is rapidly increasing each year. In addition, the Climate and Clean Air Coalition's Urban Health Initiative aims to increase monitoring in urban areas of LMIC and will be providing guidance and resources to increase air quality monitoring capacity. \nLocation of monitoring: Sampling locations of air quality measurements may change within a period of monitoring, and consequently lead to a variation over time in annual mean PM levels for a city that does not necessarily reflect actual changes in air quality but rather a difference in the pollution levels at the new measurement sites. To address such a challenge, appropriate guidance and/or a protocol can be provided to countries/cities, about the importance of maintaining specific sampling locations to monitor trends and impacts. Through its work within the Climate and Clean Air Coalition's Urban Health Initiative, WHO will be working with a number of cities to develop guidance on how and where to install air quality monitoring systems as well as the importance in consistency in monitoring practices. This information or guidance will be freely available to other cities to use and can be adapted to their local circumstances as appropriate for better monitoring of target 11.7.",,This database is updated on a regular basis can be released annually to support monitoring of this SDG target.,,,,,"Currently the WHO database houses data from over 1,600 cities, from 91 countries for the years 2008 to 2013 inclusive",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
11.7,TRUE,11,http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-11.pdf,21,"By 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible, green and public spaces, in particular for women and children, older persons and persons with disabilities.",11.7.1,"Proporción media de la superficie edificada de las ciudades correspondiente a espacios abiertos para el uso público de todos, desglosada por sexo, edad y personas con discapacidad",UN-HABITAT,,"Public space is publicly owned land and available for public use. Public spaces encompass a range of environments including streets, sidewalks squares, gardens, parks, conservation areas. Each public space has its own spatial, historic, environmental, social and economic features. They can be publically or privately managed. \n\n \nPublic Space: \nHaving sufficient public space allows cities and regions to function efficiently and equitably. Reduced amounts of public space impact negatively on quality of life, social inclusion, infrastructure development, environmental sustainable and productivity. It is documented that well designed and maintained streets and public spaces result in lower crime and violence. \nMaking space for formal and informal economic activities, recovering and maintaining public spaces for a diversity of users in a positive way, and making services and opportunities available to marginalized residents, enhance social cohesion and economic security. \nUncontrolled rapid urbanization generally creates settlement patterns with dangerously low proportions of public space. As a result, these places are unable to accommodate safe pedestrian and vehicular rights of way, land for critical infrastructure like water, sewerage and waste collection, recreational spaces, green areas and parks that contribute to social cohesion and protected ecological hotspots and corridors. \nAs new cities also develop they have reduced allocations of land for public space especially streets. On average, at 15% the land allocated to streets in new planned areas is substantially less than the standard and in unplanned areas the situation is considerably worse with an average of 2%. The generally accepted minimum standard for public space in higher density settlements (150 inhabitants or more per/hectare) is 45% (30% for streets and sidewalks and 15% for open public space).Total city space refers to the built-up area of the city. \nThe proportion of urban areas dedicated to streets and public spaces is a crucial feature of the spatial plans of cities. The road network is the integrative and dynamic factor between individuals and socioeconomic activities. It is a structuring component of geographic space and defines the socio-dynamics of an area being conditioned by the spatial pattern, which restricts the location of roads and human settlements. \nShort and direct pedestrian and cycling routes require highly connected network of paths and streets around small, permeable blocks. These features are primarily important for walking and for transit station accessibility, which can be easily discouraged by detours.\nA prosperous city seeks a tight network of paths and streets offering multiple routes to many destinations that also make walking and cycling trips varied and enjoyable. In fact, cities that have adequate streets, public spaces and greater connectivity are more liveable and productive. \nThe use of this indicator aims to integrate urban form and spatial analysis in the monitoring of Goal 11 of the Sustainable Development Goals. \nSpatial indicators are vital tools supporting sustainable urban and regional planning. They are valuable in the generation of spatial data that is critical for priority setting for harmonious and equitable distribution of resources and investments in the territory. This information supports decision-making based on evidence and facilitates effective urban management and the setting of local monitoring mechanisms to assess impact in localized areas. \nArea of public space as a proportion of total city space, including the land allocated to streets. The indicator is calculated integrating to metrics: a) land allocated to open public space; b) land allocated to streets.","Proportion of urban area allocated to open public spaces, including street and sidewalks. \n\n Proportion of Total Open Public Space = ( (Total surface of open public space + Total surface of land allocated to streets) / Total surface of built up area of the urban agglomeration ) \nUnit of Measurement: % \n\n The method to estimate the area of public space is based on three steps: 1) spatial analysis to delimit the built-up area of the city; 2) estimation of the total open public space and; 3) estimation of the total area allocated to streets. \n\t1. Spatial analysis to delimit the built-up area. Delimit the built-up area of the urban agglomeration and calculate the total area (square kilometers). \n\t\t1.1 Satellite imagery: Use of exiting layers of satellite imagery ranging from open sources such as Google Earth and US Geological Survey/NASA imagery Landsat to more sophisticated and higher resolution land cover data sets. Images will be analyzed for the latest available year. \n\t\t1.2 Delimitation of built-up area of the urban agglomeration: The delimitation of the urban agglomeration refers to the total area occupied by the built-up area and its urbanized open space. The delimitation of the study area distinguishes urban, suburban and rural areas based on the built-up densities. This indicators includes urban (more than 50% built-up density) and suburban areas (between 50% to 10% built-up density (refer to annex 1 ""Measurement of the Street Connectivity Index""). \n\t2. Open public space: mapping and calculation of total areas of open public space within the defined urban boundaries based on the built-up area. \n\t\t2.1 Definition of open public space: An open public space is related to universal access. Open public spaces include only the following types: \n\t\t\tParks: open spaces inside a municipality that provide free air recreation and contact with nature. Their principal characteristic is the significant proportion of green area. \n\t\t\tCivic parks: open spaces created by building agglomeration around an open area, which was later transformed into a representative, civic area. They are characterised by considerable nature, specifically gardens. They are good place for cultural events and passive recreation. \n\t\t\tSquares: open spaces created by building agglomeration around an open area. Its main characteristics are the significant proportion of architectonic elements and interaction among buildings and the open area. Squares are usually public spaces that are relevant to the city due to their location, territorial development, or cultural importance. \n\t\t\tRecreational green areas: public green areas that contribute to environmental preservation. All recreational green areas must guarantee accessibility and must be linked to urban areas. Their main functions are ornamental and passive recreation. \n\t\t\tFacility public areas: open meeting spaces and recreational facilities that are part of city facilities (defined as places that are elementary to all cities; i.e., public libraries, stadium, public sports centres, etc.). These areas have the following characteristics: public property, free transit and access, and both active and passive recreation. (e.g., the public area outside a stadium). \n\t\t2.2 Inventory of open public space. Information can be obtained from legal documents outlining publicly owned land and well defined land use plans. In some cases where this information is lacking, incomplete or outdated, open sources and communitybased maps, which are increasingly recognized as a valid source of information, can be a viable alternative. \n\t\t2.3 Computation of total area of open public space. The inventory of open public spaces is digitalized in existing maps and vectorised to allow computation of surfaces. The total of open public area is divided by the total built-up area of the city to obtain the proportion. \n\t3. Land allocated to streets: calculation of the total area allocated to streets based on sampling techniques as a proportion of the total surface of the built-up area as per definition above. \n\t\t3.1 Definition of streets. For this indicator, streets are defined as the space used by pedestrian or vehicles in order to go from one place to another in the city and also in order to interact. More and more, local population recognizes streets as public spaces and as an important 'common' of the city. The area of the streets include the carriageway, the median, the roundabouts, the traffic islands, the sidewalk, the cycle tracks, planting zones and storm drainage; in other words, the right of way limited by private properties and/or natural obstacles such as rivers. \nIn informal settlements or slum areas where sidewalks are missing, the main references for limiting the street area are the physical boundaries used to demarcate the private properties. Unpaved roads are also considered as streets. \n\t\t3.2 Sampling technique for the estimation of land allocated to streets. The estimation of the total area of the street is based on the following methodology: \n\t\t\ta. Define the boundary of the built-up area. \n\t\t\tb. Generate the Halton sequence of sample points of the urban area bounding box for an average density of 10 points per Km2. \n\t\t\tc. Extract the sample points that are within the urban area boundary. \n\t\t\td. Buffer the points to get sample areas (circles) with an area of 10 Ha each (0.1 Km2). \n\t\t\te. For each sample area in the sequence: i) check the completeness of the street network using 'open street maps' (OSM cartography on streets) within the sample area, and complete it if necessary comparing it with the most recent satellite imagery of the urban area; ii) define and delimit streets as per definition; iii) measure the street widths on the orthophoto (i.e. Bing) and store it in the OSM data base; iv) download the OSM cartography; v) superimpose (clip) the OSM data with the sample areas; vi) calculate the land allocated to street for each sample area. \n\t\t\tf. Repeat the process for the following sample areas until the variations are within a certain margin (95% confidence limits). \n\t\t3.3 Computation of total area of land allocated to streets. The average of the sample areas provide the total land allocated to streets. \n\n Benchmark \nProportion of Total Open Public Space \nMin = 0 % \nMax = 45 % \nTotal Open Public Space (%) \nMin = 0 % \nMax = 15 % \nLand Allocated to Street (%) \nMin = 0 % \nMax = 30% \n\n Standardization \nsee report for Standardization details \n\n Example \nsee report for Example","This indicator provides information about the amount of open public areas in a city. Cities that improve and sustain the use of public space, including streets, enhance community cohesion, civic identity, and quality of life. Having access to open public spaces does not only improve the quality of life: it is also a first step toward civic empowerment and greater access to institutional and political spaces.",,,,,,,,,,,,"In some cities, open sources data for satellite imagery may be of low quality or not clearly defined. \nTypes of open public spaces vary by city; however, the types listed above are the most commonly accepted. \nIt is unusual to obtain complete information about city streets. It is sometimes necessary to make adjustments as suggested in the methodology. This is particularly the case in slum areas. Community-based work can be a solution to this problem.",,,"Previous use of the indicator \nThis indicator has been widely use as part of the research project to monitor urban expansions in a global sample of cities (200 cities) developed by UN-Habitat and the Stern School of Business of New York University (2014/2015). \nThe indicator is also used as part of UN-Habitat City Prosperity Initiative that is being implemented in 300 cities across the world to monitor local and global conditions of city sustainability and prosperity (2012/2015). The indicator was used in a sample of 120 cities as part of the study ""Streets as Public Spaces and Drivers of Urban Prosperity"" published by UN-Habitat (2013) http://unhabitat.org/streets-as-public-spaces-and-drivers-of-urban-prosperity. \n\n Possibilities for further development \nWith sufficient data this indicator allows for sub-city analysis and for the disaggregation of the information at neighbourhood level employing Small Area Statistics Analysis. \nBased on the on-going global programme of the City Prosperity Initiative, and the use of the City Prosperity Index (CPI) the ""Land Allocated to Street"" measurement can be used as leading variable articulated to other two key metrics that use the same method to measure the efficiency of ""Urban Form"" within the dimension of infrastructure development. These two metrics are: 1) street intersection density (the number of street intersections per square kilometre of land); 2) street density (the number of kilometre of urban streets per square kilometre of land). Together these three metrics have been used to measure sustainable urban development and city prosperity in more than 200 cities. \nMoreover, based on the same initiative and the CPI further measurements of ""Open Public Space"" can be conducted by analysing the percentage of the population living in proximity to open public spaces (population located less than 300 meters away from an open public space and 1 km from a major open public space). This complementary measurement has a very strong spatial component. \n\n Recommendation \nThe proposed indicator for Target 11.7 is part of the City Prosperity Index (CPI). UNHabitat recommends that the CPI can be used as a global framework for the measurement of all targets of Goal 11 of the SDGs. With necessary adjustments, this index can identify, quantify, evaluate, monitor and report on progress made by cities and countries on Goal 11. \nThe adoption of this global framework has several advantages: adopt a systemic approach of the city; provide a single value of the state of the city; establish benchmarks for local and global monitoring; create baseline data and information; establish a global platform for comparability; identify priorities of sustainable urban development; provides evidencebased for policy-making and accountability; and create local/national monitoring mechanisms.","References \nUN-Habitat (2014) Guidelines and Metadata on the City Prosperity Initiative, use of selected indicators, Nairobi. \nUN-Habitat (2013) Streets as Public Spaces and Drivers of Urban Sustainability, Nairobi. \nUN-Habitat (2013) The relevance of street patterns and public space in urban areas, Nairobi. \nInstitute for Transportation and Development Policy (2013) TOD Standard, v. 2.0, New York. \nURL references \n[1]: http://epa.gov/smartgrowth/pdf/ptfd_primer.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The survey also included questions on stalking, sexual harassment, and the role played by new technologies in women's experiences of abuse.[3] \nTo measure sexual harassment and stalking, the survey adopted a broader scope, asking respondents first if they have experienced specific forms of sexual harassment in any situation, before asking in more detail who was involved. The information concerning the perpetrators allows the survey to distinguish incidents which are linked to various situations, including in public spaces and in employment. The survey covered 11 possible acts of sexual harassment which were unwanted and offensive according to respondents. The categories include: \n\tUnwelcome touching, hugging or kissing \n\tSexually suggestive comments or jokes that made [the respondent] feel offended \n\tInappropriate invitations to go out on dates \n\tIntrusive questions about [the respondent's] private life that made her feel offended \n\tIntrusive comments about [the respondent's] physical appearance that made her feel offended \n\tInappropriate staring or leering that made [the respondent] feel intimidated \n\tSomebody sending or showing [the respondent] sexually explicit pictures, photos or gifts that made her feel offended \n\tSomebody indecently exposing themselves to [the respondent] \n\tSomebody made [the respondent] watch or look at pornographic material against her wishes \n\tUnwanted sexually explicit emails or SMS messages that offended [the respondent] \n\tInappropriate advances that offended [the respondent] on social networking websites such as Facebook, or in internet chat rooms \nBased on these 11 items, the FRA survey revealed that at the EU level, 55% of all women have at least once been victims of sexual harassment and stalking during their lifetime and 21% have been victimized over the last 12 months.[3] In addition to examining the prevalence and nature of each of these specific acts, sexual harassment can also be analysed in four broad groups: \n\tPhysical forms of harassment: unwelcome touching, hugging or kissing; \n\tVerbal forms of harassment: sexually suggestive, offensive, comments or jokes; inappropriate invitations to go out on dates; intrusive, offensive questions about private life; intrusive, offensive comments about a woman's physical appearance; \n\tNon-verbal forms of harassment: inappropriate, intimidating staring or leering; receiving or being shown offensive, sexually explicit pictures, photos or gifts; somebody indecently exposing themselves; being made to watch or look at pornographic material against one's wishes; \n\tCyber-harassment: receiving unwanted, offensive, sexually explicit emails or SMS messages; inappropriate, offensive advances on social networking websites or in internet chat rooms.",,,"Data for this indicator can be collected through specialized violence against women surveys, crime victimization surveys or through modules in multipurpose surveys such as DHS and MICS (in the case of MICS and DHS data are limited to women aged 15-49).

The indicator has various key qualifiers that are scored between 0-5 (0-none, and 5 for full compliance). \nTools to be used to support the reporting on this indicator include: baseline, benchmarking, point-of-service surveys, scorecard, peer-review and experts opinion, performance monitoring and reporting, focus group discussions, gap and content analysis. \nWith initial support of UN-Habitat and partners tracking and assessment tools and methods will be developed, piloted and rolled out at country level to assess national urban policies developed and implemented based on the qualifiers listed above. Based on expert opinion, the assessment of the qualifiers of the indicator will target national government institutions as well as other key urban stakeholders from academia, private sector, and civil society organization, as per specific criteria of selection of these stakeholders. A threshold will be established to ascertain the level of satisfaction of each qualifier. \nThe method for tracking and analysing progress on national urban policies will collate information on adopted policies, conventions, laws, government programs, and other initiatives that comprise an urban policy.

The scorecard will point to concrete policy recommendations, particularly for qualifiers that need particular attention.","Relevance: With the majority of mankind currently living in cities, and the number poised to increase further by 2030, the success of SDGs will depend largely on how urbanisation is well coordinated and managed. Considering that urbanisation is as a tool for development, many countries8 are now embarking on the development and implementation of national urban policies as tangible instruments to coordinate stakeholders' efforts, harness the benefits of urbanisation while mitigating its externalities. \nThis particular indicator is very relevant for tracking national progress on all other areas in the SDGs and targets where urban and policies are mentioned along with the above 8 qualifiers. This indicator is one of the key metrics to benchmark and monitor urbanisation and asserts the national leadership and political will of national governments. This indicator is based on the notion that the development and implementation of national urban policies should support participation, partnership, cooperation and coordination of actors and facilitate dialogue. \nThis indicator will provide a good barometer on global progress on sustainable national urban policies. It serves as gap analysis to support policy recommendations. The indicator can identify good practices and policies among countries that can promote partnership and cooperation between all stakeholders. \nThis indicator is both process oriented and aspirational and has the potential to support the validation of Goal 11 and other SDGs indicators with an urban component. The indicators has the ability to work at multi jurisdictions level, covering a number of areas while taking care of urban challenges in a more integrated national manner. The indicator has a strong connection to the target, addressing the fundamental spatial and territorial aspect of national urban policy in the context of urban, peri-urban and rural areas. \nSuitability: \nThis indicator epitomises the universality tenet and spirit of the SDGs. It is clearly suitable for all countries and can be disaggregated and/or aggregated by areas of development as explained in the methodology section of this metadata. The indicator will be suitable to assess commitment to address urban challenges and respond to the opportunities that urbanization brings. It clearly responds to Goal 11 harnessing the power of urbanisation for the common good.

Based on the baseline developed by UNHabitat, it would be quite doable to routinely assess the status of national urban policies and ascertain progress made by countries to develop and implement policies based on agreed qualifiers. The work will benefit from various on-going initiatives of policies review and diagnostic undertaken by OECD, UN-Habitat and World Bank. Further methodological work would be needed to identify a list of criteria that have to be satisfied in order to attribute a value to the relevant developmentoriented policy (i.e. policies supporting job creation, innovation, land-use efficiency, public space, etc.). \nLimitations:\nThe data for this indicator will be based on the robustness of the assessment framework developed and pilot tested in selected countries Baseline data and benchmarks will build on UN-Habitat work on regional assessments, which need to be validated by key stakeholders. There could be a challenge for consistent and cost-effective data collection and analysis. As the indicator mainly aims to track progress on the number of countries developing and implementing national urban policies, it will not suppose specific judgements of any individual county's policies. It will not be used to produce any global or regional ranking. There might be some limitations in correlating and quantifying the contribution and attribution of urban policy to the overall change and outcomes on the ground. Nevertheless, careful design of the baseline and benchmarking would provide clear indications on the possible impact on urban policy implementation on people's quality of life",,,,"Bibliographic References: \nOECD (2015), Building Successful Cities: A National Urban Policy Framework \nOECD (Various years), Urbanisation reviews (various countries: China, Mexico, Poland, Chile, Korea) \nUN-Habitat and Cities Alliance (2014), The evolution of National Urban Policy: A global Overview \nUN-Habitat (Forthcoming): Global State of National Urban Policies \nUN-Habitat, 2015, Assessment Framework for UN-Habitat sub-programme 2 \nUN-Habitat (2015) Guiding Framework for National Urban Policy (Forthcoming) \nUN-Habitat (2015) Diagnostic Framework for NUP \nWorld Bank (Various years) Urbanisation Review (China, Colombia, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Korea, Sri Lanka, Turkey and Vietnam) \n\nURL References: \n[1]: http://unhabitat.org/initiatives-programmes/national-urban-policies/ \n[2] http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/urbandevelopment/publication/urbanization-reviews \n[3] http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/urban-rural-and-regional-development/oecd-urban-policy-reviews_23069341 \n[4] http://www.urbangateway.org/icnup/2015/home",1.4,1.5,2.3,2.a,5.2,5.a,6.1,6.2,,,,,,7.2,7.3,8.3,8.5,8.6,9.1,9.4,9.a,10.4,12.5,13.1,13.b,15.9,16.7,16.a,17.14,17.17,17.b

Increasing resilience of cities is critical to reduce disaster risk and achieve sustainable development. Cities are also very vulnerable to natural disasters, especially climate-related shocks. Over half of all coastal areas are urbanized and 21 of the world's 33 megacities lie in coastal flood zones. Coastal cities are particularly affected by sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion, and extreme events (e.g. tsunamis and storm surges) due to the undermining natural protective barriers, low levels of development combined with rapid population growth in low lying coastal areas and inadequate capacity to adapt. In addition to the impact on communities and non-human species, the unplanned urbanization also undermines the ecosystem services that support much hard urban infrastructure. This type of development also exacerbates urban vulnerability to climate change impacts, including hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. \nLocated mostly in cities where disadvantaged groups are situated and when affordable access is addressed, resilient infrastructures such as health, education, road and other critical infrastructures will have direct impact on reducing inequality and making growth more inclusive and sustainable. \nThe opportunity is that 60% of the area expected to be urban by 2030 remains to be built, indicating that the shape of future cities can be proactively guided into more risk-sensitive development.

It is expected that sub-national information is key. If based on and sourced from an accounting structure, information by tourism industries could be possible (as these industries' productive activity make up Tourism Direct GDP).",,"While it is understood that the indicator is an attempt at presenting an indicator that could approximate for the ""sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism"", the indicator poses important challenges. \nFirst, there is no conceptual framework that specifically caters to links between tourism and environmental accounts to base this indicator on. The framework for measuring tourism exists (International Recommendations for Tourism Statistics 2008 and Tourism Satellite Account: Recommended Methodological Framework 2008) as well as the framework for environmental-economic accounts (System of Environmental Economic Accounts 2012), but a linking of the two is required. Even though this is something that UNWTO will embark on together with a number countries, UNSD, and OECD and counting on the support of the UNCEEA, the production of internationally comparable data on (something that could approximate for) ""sustainable tourism"" in a significant number of countries still has some years to go. \nData availability is the second biggest challenge, even if a conceptual framework gets developed. While UNWTO is aware of a number of countries that have developed pilot exercises of linking tourism and environmental accounts to produce data for indicators relating key environmental aggregates (notably energy use, GHG emissions, and their intensities) to tourism activity, this is far from being an endeavour that, presently, more than a handful of countries could provide data on, let alone structurally incorporate it into their programmes of work over the medium term. \nThere is the added challenge that the concept of ""sustainable tourism"" as stated in the target is mainly a policy construct and not defined nor part of an established or internationally conceptual/statistical framework at this point. \nIf this indicator is kept it is proposed that, for the time being, it be interpreted in its broadest sense to consider as residuals not only solid waste but also emissions to air and water and wastewater. This would give some flexibility to, after analysis and testing, ultimately opt for the residual(s) that can best cater to the information need for this target. An example of one such candidates could be: \n\tGHG emissions related to tourism: possibly defined as ""GHG emissions from the tourism industries""or a more ambitious ""Direct GHG emissions from (selected) tourism industries"" or possibly even ""Direct GHG emissions intensity for tourism in terms of terms of number of (FTE) jobs"" (which would unite several dimensions relevant to the target). \nIf testing shows that the indicator cannot be viably produced in a significant number of countries, other possible indicators relating tourism and the environment that could be sourced from linked SEEA-TSA accounts should be considered. A possibility could be to shift the focus away from residuals and towards SEEA accounts with wider (and more detailed) data availability. A priori a possibility to be considered could be: \n\tEnergy use related to tourism: possibly defined as ""energy use in the tourism industries"" or a more ambitious ""Direct energy use in (selected) tourism industries"" or possibly even ""Direct energy use intensity for tourism in terms of terms of number of FTE jobs"" (which would unite several dimensions relevant to the target). \nLast but certainly not least, it could be argued that the focus of the target is on ""Develop and implement tools to monitor [sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism ']"". \nIndeed, the Target itself acknowledges that ""tools to monitor [sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism]"" need to be developed. If this is considered to be the main focus, then an indicator that tracks precisely this in countries would be more appropriate: \n\t""Stage of implementation of linked SEEA-TSA accounts in country"" or, alternatively, ""Stage of implementation of TSA in country""\nAn advantage of such an indicator is that it could be a powerful motivator to further the necessary statistical development in countries in order to better understand also the other dimensions of the target: ""sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products"". An indicator focusing on developing the tools to monitor tourism in relation to sustainability also matches better the incipient stage of statistical development in this area (both conceptually and regarding implementation in countries).",,,System of Environmental Economic Accounts 2012 (SEEA 2012) \nTourism Satellite Account: Recommended Methodological Framework (TSA: RMF 2008),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SIDS and coastal regions are particularly affected by sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion, and extreme events (e.g. tsunamis and storm surges) due to the undermining natural protective barriers, low levels of development combined with rapid population growth in low lying coastal areas and inadequate capacity to adapt.

For the poor, a shock of even a relatively short impact and duration can have long term consequences. Several dimensions of poverty are closely related to environment, which is often affected by natural disasters. Better management of natural resources can themselves strengthen the resilience of the poor, by both reducing the likelihood of natural hazard events and offering resources to help cope with them. \nThese challenges require enhanced vulnerability and impact assessments, mitigation and adaptation plans, resilience building and DRR strategies. It is necessary to adapt to climate change, enhance resilience of ecosystems, and reduce disaster risk and build resilience to natural disasters. \nProactive DRR strategies will address climate change impact and enhance resilience of nations.

It includes people who are presumed dead although there is no physical evidence. The data on number of deaths and number of missing are mutually exclusive. \nAffected people: People who are affected by a hazardous event. \nComment: People can be affected directly or indirectly.

This indicator, while not perfect, comes from data widely available and could be used consistently across countries and over time to measure the achievement of the Target B. \nFrom the perspective of data availability and measurability, it is proposed to build a composite indicator which consists of ""directly affected"", or those who are \n\tInjured or ill, \n\tEvacuated, \n\tRelocated \nand to measure the number who suffered direct damage to their livelihoods or assets, \n\tPeople whose houses were damaged or destroyed \n\tPeople who received food relief aid. \nInjured or ill: The number of people suffering from physical injuries, trauma or cases of disease requiring immediate medical assistance as a direct result of a hazardous event. \nEvacuated: The number of people who temporarily moved from where they were (including their place of residence, work places, schools and hospitals) to safer locations in order to ensure their safety. \nRelocated: The number of people who moved permanently from their homes to new sites due to hazardous event. Note: This definition excludes preventive relocation before the event. \nPeople whose houses were damaged or destroyed due to hazardous events: The estimated number of inhabitants previously living in the houses (housing units) damaged or destroyed. All the inhabitants of these houses (housing units) are assumed to be affected being in their dwelling or by direct consequence of the destruction/damage to their housings (housing units). An average number of inhabitants per house (housing unit) in the country can be used to estimate the value. \nHouses destroyed: Houses (housing units) levelled, buried, collapsed, washed away or damaged to the extent that they are no longer habitable. \nHouses damaged: Houses (housing units) with minor damage, not structural or architectural, which may continue to be habitable, although they may require some repair or cleaning. \nPeople who received food relief aid: The number of persons who received food /nutrition, by government or as humanitarian aid, during or in the aftermath of a hazardous event. \nHazardous event: The occurrence of a natural or human-induced phenomenon in a particular place during a particular period of time due to the existence of a hazard. \nHazard: A potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon or human activity that may cause the loss of life or injury, property damage, social and economic disruption or environmental degradation. \nUNISDR recommends setting NO threshold for recording hazardous event in order to monitor all hazardous events. Small-scale but frequent hazardous events that are not registered in international disaster loss databases account for an important share of damages and losses when they are combined, and often go unnoticed by the national and international community. These events, when accumulated, are often a source of poverty in developing countries but can be effectively addressed by well-designed policies. The scope of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 is ""the risk of small-scale and large-scale, frequent and infrequent, sudden and slow-onset disasters, caused by natural or man-made hazards as well as relate environmental, technological and biological hazards and risks"". \nRegarding the inclusion of biological and environmental hazards in natural hazards category and whether and how to integrate man-made hazards, UNISDR will discuss the issue with WHO and other organizations (for example, WHO would be in a better position in terms of data, knowledge and relationship with Member States and other stakeholders to monitor biological events including epidemics. However, we generally do not expect biological disasters will cause physical damages to facilities. ). \n\tNote: Terminology will be discussed and finalized in the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group for Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reductio","Summation of data on related indicators from national disaster loss databases. Make the sum a relative figure by using global population data (World Bank or UN Statistics information). Relativity is important because population growth (expected to be 9 billion in 2050) may translate into increased hazard exposure of population. \nThe Expert Group recommends not using the indicators related with the people whose houses were damaged/destroyed in the computation. UNISDR and IRDR groups recommend using them as they can be estimated from widely available and verifiable data and reflect vulnerability and livelihood issues. Data on housing damage and destroyed is essential for economic loss, so using these indicators would not impose additional data collection burden. \nDouble-counting: From practical perspective, double counting of affected people is unavoidable (for example, injured and relocated) in many countries. Minimum double counting is summing ""number of injured"" and Number of people whose housings were damaged or destroyed. Relocated is sub-set of number of people whose housings were destroyed. \nThe data can be disaggregated by hazard type.

Healthy ecosystems act as buffers against natural hazards, providing valuable yet underutilized approaches for climate change adaptation, enhancing natural resilience and reducing the vulnerability of people, for example to floods and the effects of land degradation. These ecosystem services improve the sustainability and economic efficiency of built infrastructure, and are critical for sustainable and resilient urban areas. \nThis indicator will track human-related loss.

Each stock was estimated using the method described in FAO Technical Paper 569. If the stock has abundance below the level that can produce maximum sustainable yield, it was counted as overfished.

As such, the biodiversity and the functioning of the fishery ecosystem will be impaired. In addition, this will have a negative impact on food supply.","Yes, FAO has maintained and reported this indicator since 1974.\nThe global fish stock assessment program has been carried out by the Fishery Department and has been incorporated into its regular program activities. The assessment is usually done every 2 or 3 years.","Reliability \nThis is probably the most quoted and used indicator on fisheries (e.g. the Global Biodiversity Outlook, reports from the Millennium Development Goal process, etc.) and the most widely accepted indicator at the global level. This because it was the earliest indicator established and it uses the most comprehensive approach in comparison with other recently emerged indicators and methodologies. \nCoverage \nIt is global, covering about 57% of the global catch. But it is not conducted by country. There are no current plans to do this by country because 1) fish migrates across areas beyond national jurisdictions, and 2) we don't want to get into political problems. But, there would be some hope to attempt this if funds are made available. \nComparability across countries \nThe assessment is not at country level, so not comparable among countries. \nSub-national estimates \nNo such estimates currently exist.","There are a number of targets have been proposed for this indicator.

It is a thematic disaggregation of the multi-purpose indicator for protected area coverage of important sites. \nConcepts \nProtected areas, as defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), are clearly defined geographical spaces, recognized, dedicated and managed, through legal or other effective means, to achieve the long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values. Importantly, a variety of specific management objectives are recognised within this definition, spanning conservation, restoration, and sustainable use: \n\tCategory Ia: Strict nature reserve \n\tCategory Ib: Wilderness area \n\tCategory II: National park \n\tCategory III: Natural monument or feature \n\tCategory IV: Habitat/species management area \n\tCategory V: Protected landscape/seascape \n\tCategory VI: Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources \nThe status ""designated"" is attributed to a protected area when the corresponding authority, according to national legislation or common practice (e.g., by means of an executive decree or the like), officially endorses a document of designation. The designation must be made for the purpose of biodiversity conservation, not de facto protection arising because of some other activity (e.g., military). \nSites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity are identified following globally standard criteria applied at national levels. Two variants of these standard criteria have been applied in all countries to date. The first is for the identification of Important Bird & Biodiversity Areas (IBAs), that is, sites contributing significantly to the global persistence of biodiversity, identified using data on birds, of which >12,000 sites in total have been identified from all of the world's countries. The second is for the identification of Alliance for Zero Extinction sites (AZEs), that is, sites holding effectively the entire population of at least one species assessed as Critically Endangered or Endangered on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. In total, 587 AZE sites have been identified for 920 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, conifers, and reef-building corals. A global standard for the identification of key biodiversity areas (KBAs) unifying these approaches along with other mechanisms for identification of important sites for other species and ecosystems is in the final stages of development and anticipated to be in place by the end of 2015. Marine sites are defined as those identified for marine species or ecosystems, as documented in the IUCN Red List Habitats Classification Scheme.","The indicator is computed by dividing the total number of KBAs wholly covered by protected areas by the total number of KBAs in each country, and multiplying by 100. 'Wholly protected' is defined as >98% coverage to allow for resolution and digitisation errors in the underlying spatial datasets.","The safeguard of important sites is vital for stemming the decline in biodiversity. The establishment of protected areas is an important mechanism for achieving this aim, and this indicator serves as a means of measuring progress toward the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of marine ecosystems and their services, in line with obligations under international agreements. Importantly, it is not restricted to any single marine ecosystem type, and so faithfully reflects the intent of SDG target 14.2. \nLevels of access to protected areas vary among the protected area management categories. Some areas, such as scientific reserves, are maintained in their natural state and closed to any other use. Others are used for recreation or tourism, or even open for the sustainable extraction of natural resources. \nIn addition to protecting biodiversity, protected areas have become places of high social and economic value: supporting local livelihoods; protecting watersheds from erosion; harbouring an untold wealth of genetic resources; supporting thriving recreation and tourism industries; providing for science, research and education; and forming a basis for cultural and other non-material values. \nThis indicator adds meaningful information to, complements and builds from traditionally reported simple statistics of territorial area covered by protected areas, computed by dividing the total protected area within a country by the total territorial area of the country and multiplying by 100. Such percentage area coverage statistics do not recognise the extreme variation of biodiversity importance over space, and so risk generating perverse outcomes through the protection of areas which are large at the expense of those which require protection.",,,,,,,"Protected area data are compiled by ministries of environment and other ministries responsible for the designation and maintenance of protected areas. They are compiled globally into the World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) by the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC). They are disseminated through the Protected Planet knowledge product http://www.protectedplanet.net/, which is jointly managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN and its World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA). \nKBAs are identified at national scales through multi-stakeholder processes. Data on IBAs are managed by BirdLife International, and are available online at http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/site/search. Data on AZEs are managed by the Alliance for Zero Extinction, and are available online at http://www.zeroextinction.org/. Both datasets, along with the WDPA, are also disseminated through the Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool for Research and Conservation Planning, available online at https://www.ibatalliance.org/ibat-conservation/login.",,,"Given that data for the global indicator are compiled at national levels, it is straightforward to disaggregate to national and regional levels, or conversely to aggregate to the global level. The indicator can also be reported in combination across marine (and terrestrial and freshwater) systems, or disaggregated among them. However, protected areas, IBAs, and AZEs can encompass terrestrial, freshwater, and marine systems simultaneously, and so determining the results is not simply additive. Finally, it can be disaggregated according to different protected area management categories (categories I'VI) to reflect differing specific management objectives of protected areas. \nIn addition to the aggregation of the coverage of protected areas across terrestrial and freshwater systems as an indicator towards SDG 15.1, other disaggregations of coverage of protected areas of particular relevance as indicators towards SDG targets include: \n\tSDG 6.6 Coverage of protected areas (freshwater). \n\tSDG 14.2 Coverage of protected areas (marine). \n\tSDG 15.4 Coverage of protected areas (mountain). \n\tProtected area coverage data can be combined with other data sources to yield further, complementary, indicators. For example, protected area overlay with ecoregional maps can be used to provide information on protected area coverage of different broad biogeographical regions. Protected area coverage of the distributions of different groups of species (e.g., mammals, birds, amphibians) can similarly provide indicators of trends in coverage of biodiversity at the species level. Protected area coverage can be combined with the IUCN Red List Index to generate indicators of the impacts of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss. Finally, indicators derived from protected area overlay can also inform sustainable urban development; for example, the overlay of protected areas onto urban maps could provide an indicator of public space as a proportion of overall city space.","UNEP-WCMC is the agency in charge of calculating and reporting global and regional figures for this indicator, working with BirdLife International and IUCN to combine data on protected areas with those for sites of importance for biodiversity. UNEP-WCMC aggregates the global and regional figures on protected areas from the national figures that are calculated from the WDPA and disseminated through Protected Planet. The WDPA and Protected Planet are jointly managed by UNEP-WCMC and IUCN WCPA. \nUNEP-WCMC produces the UN List of Protected Areas every 5-10 years, based on information provided by national ministries/agencies. In the intervening period between compilations of UN Lists, UNEP-WCMC works closely with national ministries/agencies and NGOs responsible for the designation and maintenance of protected areas, continually updating the WDPA as new data become available. \nQuality control criteria are applied to ensure consistency and comparability of the data in the WDPA. New data are validated at UNEP-WCMC through a number of tools and translated into the standard data structure of the WDPA. Discrepancies between the data in the WDPA and new data are resolved in communication with data providers. Processed data are fully integrated into the published WDPA. \nThe WDPA is held within a Geographic Information System (GIS) that stores information about protected areas such as their name, size, type, date of establishment, geographic location (point) and/or boundary (polygon). \nProtected area coverage is calculated using all the protected areas recorded in WDPA whose location and extent is known. Protected areas without digital boundaries are excluded from the indicator. \nIBAs are places of international significance for the conservation of biodiversity, identified using data for birds. IBAs are identified using a standardised set of data-driven criteria and thresholds, relating to threatened, restricted-range, biome-restricted and congregatory species. IBAs are delimited so that, as far as possible, they: (a) are different in character, habitat or ornithological importance from surrounding areas; (b) provide the requirements of the trigger species (i.e., those for which the site qualifies) while present, alone or in combination with networks of other sites; and (c) are or can be managed in some way for conservation. \nAZEs are sites meeting three criteria: endangerment (supporting at least one Endangered or Critically Endangered species, as listed on the IUCN Red List); irreplaceability (holding the sole or overwhelmingly significant ('95%) known population of the target species, for at least one life history segment); and discreteness (having a definable boundary within which the character of habitats, biological communities, and/or management issues have more in common with each other than they do with those in adjacent areas). Hence AZEs represent locations at which species extinctions are imminent unless appropriately safeguarded (i.e. protected or managed sustainably in ways consistent with the persistence of populations of target species). \nThe IBA and AZE site networks are, by definition, areas of particular importance for biodiversity as referred to in Aichi Biodiversity Target 11, and represent the only networks of such sites that have been identified systematically worldwide. Hence, they represent important areas to consider designating as formal protected areas.","The indicator does not measure the effectiveness of protected areas in reducing biodiversity loss, which ultimately depends on a range of management and enforcement factors not covered by the indicator. A number of initiatives are underway to address this limitation. Most notably, numerous mechanisms have been developed for assessment of protected area management effectiveness, which can be synthesised into an indicator of management effectiveness. This is used by the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership as a complementary indicator of progress towards Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 (http://www.bipindicators.net/pamanagement). More recently, approaches to ""green listing""have started to be developed, to incorporate both management effectiveness and the outcomes of protected areas, and these are likely to become progressively important as they are tested and applied more broadly. \nData and knowledge gaps can arise due to difficulties in determining whether a site conforms to the IUCN definition of a protected area, and some protected areas are not assigned management categories. Moreover, ""other effective area-based conservation measures"", as specified by Aichi Biodiversity Target 11 of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011'2020, recognise that some sites beyond the formal protected area network, while not managed primarily for nature conservation, may nevertheless be managed in ways which are consistent with the persistence of the biodiversity for which they are important. However, standard approaches to documentation of ""other effective area-based conservation measures"" are so far still in their infancy. As these are consolidated, ""other effective areabased conservation measures"" will be included into the WDPA and thus this indicator accordingly. \nRegarding important sites, the biggest limitation is that site identification to date has focused on specific subsets of biodiversity, for example birds (for IBAs) and highly threatened species (for AZEs). While IBAs have been documented to be good surrogates for biodiversity more generally, the unification of standards for identification of important sites across different levels of biodiversity (genes, species, ecosystems) and different taxonomic groups remains a high priority. This umbrella standard for identification of key biodiversity areas is anticipated to be finalised by the end of 2015, building strongly from existing approaches. \nDates of establishment are not recorded for some protected areas in some countries, generating uncertainty around changing protected area coverage over time. This is reflected in the indicator by assigning dates of establishment for undated sites by selecting dates at random from those for other protected areas in the same country, repeating this 1,000 times, and plotting the 95% confidence intervals around mean protected area coverage accordingly.","There are no direct gender equity issues associated with the indicator for coverage of important sites for biodiversity by protected areas. However, it is essential to recognise that women play a central role in the conservation, management and use of biodiversity. In many rural areas of developing countries, women's daily tasks are often tied closely to biodiversity. They are often responsible for gathering edible wild plants (fruits, leaves and roots of native plants) to feed their families as a supplement to agricultural grains, especially during unfavourable situations such as famine, conflicts and epidemics. Women often also gather medicinal plants, firewood and other bush products for medicine, fuel, house-building, paint and even manure and pesticide. Women's knowledge of biodiversity is immense and broad, because their communities' well-being depends on it, and preservation of this knowledge is crucial for maintaining biodiversity. Yet, their contribution is often overlooked. They are typically ""invisible"" partners from grassroots to policy level. There is therefore an urgent need to consider gender issues in development efforts, to promote true partnership and ensure the sustainable conservation and use of biodiversity.",,,"BIRDLIFE INTERNATIONAL (2014) Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas: a global network for conserving nature and benefiting people.

Wild stock, as fish stocks captured for two main purposes: \n\t\t(i) landed in volumes (tons in live weight or live weight equivalent) for direct use as feed or for reduction as fish meal and fish oil as feed ingredients for fed aquaculture species, and \n\t\t(ii) caught in numbers or volume in tons in live weight for use as seed / stocking materials for aquaculture grow-out facilities (capture-based aquaculture)",,,,,"Target 14.7 implies that economic benefits can be derived from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through aquaculture. In fact aquaculture can generate economic benefits, and increase in aquaculture production can increase economic benefits. Increases in aquaculture productivity can further contribute to economic benefits when the natural resources are utilized more efficiently, i.e. when aquaculture yield is enhanced while the use of natural resources is better managed.","FAO collects statistical data globally on aquaculture grow-out production (production volumes and values), seed production (in numbers), and surface areas covered (hectares) and volumes (m3 ) of cages and raceway used by aquaculture operations. However, only aquaculture grow-out production volumes and values are published annually, while other compiled data sets (i.e. surface areas covered and volumes of cages and raceways and seed production, as submitted by members) have been utilized only for the internal analysis, e.g. for SOFIA, due to significant problems in quality and coverage of reported data, and rather low reporting rates. \nIt is emphasized that FAO has data sets for areas (including both land and water surface areas; N.B. hectares or m2 ) covered by aquaculture, as reported to FAO, although these data sets are not yet complete and not yet available for publication/distribution. Progress is being made with compilation and presentation of area coverage data, and may be published in foreseeable future. \nIn comparison to such land cover data, data on aquaculture water use (i.e. volumes of water; N.B. km3 or litres) are much more complex and much more difficult to obtain by and from most members. Therefore, many of the countries as well as FAO would as yet not be able to report and present data on water use in aquaculture. FAO has collected some information on seed collected from wild or produced for aquaculture purposes but these data are still in development. While FAO regularly collects information on amount of fish utilized for fish meals/ fish oil manufacturing, no information is available on a proportion to be used for aquaculture. Similarly, no systematic data is available for amount of trash fish and other wild fish being captured and directly fed for aquaculture grow-out purposes. FAO does not regularly collect data on aquaculture feeds and related ingredients, as such data are not regularly supplied by national statistical offices. However, reviews of aquaculture feeds and fertilizer uses and sources of feed ingredients are being undertaken by FAO and other institutions and organizations. Such reviews provide information on e.g. use of fish meal and fish oil for aquaculture feeds. For example, IFFO ' the Marine Ingredients Organization (iffo.net), representing industry interests, publishes opinion papers and research report on these aspects but does not regularly issue related data sets. \nIn conclusion, the proposed aquaculture productivity indicator has not yet been established as a standard and readily available indicator. While data on aquaculture production are regularly provided by members, data sets on the use of natural resources in aquaculture are still being developed, with coverage and quality of data on land area use being much more advanced than water use and use of wild stocks. \nFAO/FI continues to successfully enhance the database on land area use in aquaculture while data coverage is still insufficient for many countries, including some major producing countries. Data sets on aquaculture water use and wild-seed collection would require additional substantial investments in most countries. Collection of data on aquaculture feeds would need to be evaluated for feasibility and cost implications both in member countries and in FAO. \nIn order to make this indicator comparable among countries as well as among economic benefits obtained by other sectors by utilizing natural resources, it is important to establish direct links with the SEEA Central Framework. The SEEA Central Framework already integrated the natural resources in concern here, i.e. water, land and aquatic biological resources. The Coordinating Working Party on Fisheries Statistics (CWP) adopted the standard requirement for aquaculture statistics in 2013 that include the reporting of seeds and feeds and define a format of their measures. \nCurrently, FAO's aquaculture questionnaire, as dispatched annually to national reporting offices, does include entries for use/coverage of land (hectares) and use of freshwater (m3 ) for some aquaculture systems. However, response by member countries statistical offices as well as in-house capacities for collection and management of such data sets continue to need substantial support. \nResearch on feasibility and costs of collection of data on seed production, capture-based aquaculture, and fisheries-based aquaculture feeds would need to be planned and would need to be funded most likely with additional resources, if made available.","Reliability \nGiven significant issues of coverage and quality of presently unpublished data on area coverage by aquaculture, the need to further develop data sets on water use, and the required research on feasibility and costs of regularly collecting data on seed production and capture-based aquaculture, let alone fisheries based aquaculture feed production, it appears that the proposed indicator would not satisfy expectations on reliability for all parameters. \nHowever, the proposed indicator specifically on productivity of aquaculture in utilizing land (land water area covered by aquaculture) can satisfy expectations on reliability as long as member countries commit to collect data on land use in aquaculture. \nCoverage \nGiven the above, coverage (geographic, temporal) at this stage cannot be assured for this indicator. \nComparability across countries \nComparability across countries would still need to be researched based on collection of actual data. \nSub-national estimates \nYes, based on some selected data sets, as available primarily for area coverage by aquaculture operations, it would be possible to compute the indicator for productivity over land cover (i.e. aquaculture production per area coverage; tonnes/ha) for specific aquaculture contexts and/or geographical areas.","There is no baseline value for 2015. Most likely, targets would be meaningful if formulated more specifically for aquaculture species groups or commodities. Significant differences exist not only between various aquaculture systems and species utilized, but also for socio-economic, environmental and developmental parameters between countries and regions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, the Guidelines do not prescribe a standard definition of small-scale fisheries nor do they prescribe how the Guidelines should be applied in a national context. These Guidelines are especially relevant to subsistence small-scale fisheries and vulnerable fisheries people. To ensure transparency and accountability in the application of the Guidelines, it is important to ascertain which activities and operators are considered small-scale, and to identify vulnerable and marginalized groups needing greater attention. This should be undertaken at a regional, sub-regional or national level and according to the particular context in which they are to be applied. States should ensure that such identification and application are guided by meaningful and substantive participatory, consultative, multilevel and objectiveoriented processes so that the voices of both men and women are heard. All parties should support and participate, as appropriate and relevant, in such processes.'\nThe target is focusing on access to resources and markets for small-scale fisheries, in line with the Rio+20 outcome document (http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N11/476/10/PDF/N1147610.pdf?OpenElement) para, 175. In order to guarantee secure access, an enabling environment is necessary which recognizes and protects small-scale fisheries rights. Such an enabling environment requires appropriate legal, regulatory and policy frameworks and related institutional mechanisms as well their effective application.","There is currently no such indicator but the biennial FAO survey questionnaire on the CCRF implementation will include new questions in relation to small-scale fisheries and the implementation of the SSF Guidelines. The first results will become available for COFI in 2016, allowing for the definition of a baseline and starting period for this indicator. COFI 2016 can provide an opportunity to sharpen the questions if needed. In addition, there will be a specific COFI agenda item on small-scale fisheries. Data could therefore be produced at country level every two years for COFI through the electronic questionnaire.","Reliability \nFAO Member Countries are invited every two years to respond to the FAO CCRF Survey and responses are reviewed and compiled and presented by FAO to COFI.

The indicator examines the application by countries of a legal/regulatory/policy/institutional framework for the recognition and protection of access rights for small-scale fisheries. However, this can be expected to be a complex process which could require substantial amount of time to advance legal, administrative and capacity development efforts. A realistic numerical target for 2030 could be envisaged, but would need to be confirmed based on survey responses and results in the next survey effort.

Note: Some agroforestry systems such as the ""Taungya"" system where crops are grown only during the first years of the forest rotation should be classified as forest. \nTotal land area is the total surface area of a country less the area covered by inland waters, like major rivers and lakes.",,,,,"Forests fulfil a number of functions that are vital for humanity, including the provision of goods (wood and nonwood forest products) and services such as habitat for biodiversity, carbon sequestration, coastal protection and soil and water conservation. \nThe indicator provides a measure of the relative extent of forest in a country. The availability of accurate data on a country's forest area is a key element for forest policy and planning within the context of sustainable development. Changes in forest area reflect the demand for land for other uses and may help identify unsustainable practices in the forestry and agricultural sector. \nForest area as percentage of total land area may be used as a rough proxy for the extent to which the forests in a country are being conserved or restored, but it is only partly a measure for the extent to which they are sustainably managed. \nThis is indicator is primarily proposed for Target 15.1.

(Resolution A/RES/62/98) \nAn ""index of sustainable forest management"" with four sub-indicators can be used as a basic indicator of progress towards sustainable forest management by a country. The four sub-indicators are \n\t1. Annual average percent change in forest area over most recent available 5 year period \n\t2. Annual average percent change in stock of carbon in above ground biomass over most recent available 5 year period \n\t3. Share of forest area whose primary designated function is biodiversity conservation, most recent period \n\t4. Share of forest area under a forest management plan, of which forest area certified under an independent forest management certification scheme, most recent period \nFor each of these components, countries can set national targets, monitor and report on progress. The four sub-indicators will be combined into a single composite index, but targets would be set at the level of sub-indicators. Once targets have been set by national authorities, in terms of the four sub-indicators, and progress measured over an agreed period, countries would assess progress (on track to exceed target, on track to achieve target, progress but at an insufficient rate, no significant overall progress, moving away from target). The final value of the index would be a simple arithmetic average of the values for the four sub-indicators. The use of national targets allows each country to define sustainable forest management for its own specific circumstances, within a coherent international framework. Targets on the sub-indicators can also be set at regional or global levels.",,"The definition of SFM by UN GA contains several key aspects, notably that sustainable forest management is a concept which varies over time and between countries, whose circumstances ' ecological, social and economic ' vary widely, but that it should always address a wide range of forest values, including economic, social and environmental values, and take intergenerational equity into account. \nClearly a simple measure of change in forest area, while essential, and used for target 15.1, is insufficient to monitor sustainable forest management as a whole. The index proposed combines the two indicators at present under consideration (""forest loss"" and ""area certified"") with measures of use/degradation (sub-indicator 2), biodiversity conservation (sub-indicator 3) to give a more rounded picture of sustainable forest management. Further ""topical"" sub-indicators will be needed to provide a more comprehensive assessment of SFM aspects. The significance of the four sub-indicators may be briefly explained as follows: \n\t1. Trends in forest area are crucial for monitoring SFM: clearly, if there is significant uncontrolled deforestation, forest management is not sustainable. The indicator focuses on change as there is no ideal share of forest in land cover, as the share is determined by history, ecological circumstances and competing land uses. The indicator covers the net effect of the other parts of Target 15.2: ""halt deforestation"" and ""substantially increase afforestation and reforestation"". However most countries have reliable data on the components of this overall trend (deforestation, afforestation and reforestation), for which separate targets can be specified, if so desired. This component incorporates the concept of ""net permanent forest loss "" at present classified ""green"" and is also used for Target 15.1 \n\t2. Changes in the stock of biomass are determined by the balance between increase in volume of wood biomass (annual increment) and decrease (natural losses and damage by fire insects etc., and wood harvest). In a sustainably managed forest, increment is more than losses, so that the biomass stock increases, or does not decrease, and carbon is sequestered from the atmosphere. With very few exceptions, a decline in total biomass stocks, even if the forest area does not decrease, implies unsustainable management (and possible degradation). As the wood/carbon ratio is constant, there will be exactly the same trends for carbon stocks as for wood biomass. Therefore a single indicator addresses carbon stocks and flows and trends in growing stock of wood, and may be expressed in m3 of wood or in tons of carbon. \n\t3. Forest areas managed for the conservation of biodiversity are a proxy for trends in forest biodiversity and a clear indication of political will to incorporate biodiversity into forest management. The CBD Aichi Target 11 calls for each country to conserve at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water areas, so this may be taken as a goal for this element. Work is in hand on developing a number of indicators of forest biodiversity, which may be useful in the future. \n\t4. The fourth parameter looks at the area within a country where a key tool for sustainable forest management is applied. The existence of a ""forest management plan"" is a necessary tool for evidence based, long term management. Those areas that are certified by third party schemes as being sustainably managed work on the basis of an independently verified management plan. While the latter fulfils a higher standard, it should be pointed out that there are very significant areas of sustainably managed forest which are not certified, either because their owners have chosen not to seek certification (which is voluntary and market-based) or because no credible (or affordable) certification scheme is in place for that area. The latter is true for most tropical countries. For this reason, using ""area of certified forest"" as the sole indicator could give a misleading impression.",,,,,,,"Countries, through official government-nominated correspondents, provide data for all four elements through established data collection mechanisms, in particular the Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) of FAO. Most recently published in 2015. Data on the subindicators is available from practically all countries and territories, accompanied by extensive metadata on sources, definitions, conversion from national data to international standards and data quality. All FRA data are submitted (and officially approved) by national authorities. To the extent that the indicator uses terms compatible with FRA, comparable data are easily available and national statistical offices can validate and modify them as necessary. \nDefinitions and concepts used for the sub-indicators have been specified and agreed over many years of international collaboration between experts nominated by national governments, international bodies and UN agencies. Data supplied by national authorities follow the agreed FRA2015 terms and definitions, which are now well known and accepted by forest specialists. See Forest Resources Assessment Working Paper - 180: FRA 2015 Terms and Definitions, available at http://www.fao.org/forestry/fra/2560/en/",,,,"See also ""Sources and data collection"". Data can be provided directly by member countries or, if necessary, taken from the FAO database at http://www.fao.org/forest-resourcesassessment/explore-data/en/. The parameters chosen are all measured directly at the national level, so countries can easily set their target values. If it is considered desirable to aggregate to the regional or global level, this presents no conceptual problems.","The four elements all address major concerns, but, for conceptual and data reasons, some aspects of sustainable forest management are not included, notably jobs and livelihoods, revenue and valuation of benefits, forest health and vitality, protection function of forests (soil, water, erosion etc.). Regional and inter-regional collaboration between countries has been on-going for around 15 years to monitor aspects of sustainable forest management in more detail, supported by intergovernmental bodies. The sub-indicators used in this context build a solid foundation for the further development of more specific ""thematic""indicators. However at present, this more comprehensive approach gives results which are too complex and location specific for inclusion in the global multi-sector SDG indicator set. \nForest degradation: UNCCD is working together with FAO on land degradation under target 15.3 so degradation of forest land, as mentioned in Target 15.2 (""restore degraded forests"") may be monitored through that indicator. Trends in biomass, especially when put on a per hectare basis, can give some indication of forest degradation. \nProtective functions of forests: A Mountain Green Index is being developed for Target 15.4.

Its increase will be due to vegetation growth possibly linked to reforestation or afforestation programmes. The proposed Index will provide a meaningful proxy for assessing the progress of all three mountain targets (i.e., 6.6.; 15.1; and 15.4). If an order of relevance is needed, this is our proposed ranking: \n\ta) 15.4 \n\tb) 15.1 \n\tc) 6.6 \nWe assign priority to 15.4 because this is solely ""pure"" mountain indicator.","This indicator does not exist yet but it can be developed using the existing dataset Global Land Cover (GLC) SHARE maintained by FAO's NRL Division. \nThe data set GLC SHARE developed by FAO's NRL Division will be used as basis for the computation of the indicator, jointly with the definition of mountain areas as provided by UNEP-WCMC Produced in 2000 by UNEP-WCMC, the first map of the world's mountains defined them according to altitude, slope and local elevation range: \n\tClass 1: Elevation > 4,500 metres \n\tClass 2: Elevation 3,500'4,500 metres \n\tClass 3: Elevation 2,500'3,500 metres \n\tClass 4: Elevation 1,500'2,500 metres and slope > 2 \n\tClass 5: Elevation 1,000'1,500 metres and slope > 5 or local elevation range (LER(*) 7 kilometre radius) > 300 metres \n\tClass 6: Elevation 300'1,000 metres and local elevation range (7 kilometre radius) > 300 metres outside 23N'19S \nAs a first step and in order to define the baseline, the exercise will initially provide an overview of the current vegetation cover in mountain areas (based on GLC-SHARE 2014), and will include maps and area calculations of the current amount of woody vegetation (trees/shrubs) cover for each country, region and at global level and also by mountain class layer. \nIn five years' time, a comparison will be undertaken between GLC-SHARE 2014 and that of 2019 from which a trend will be extrapolated. \nThis five-year monitoring cycle is subject to the release of the GLC-SHARE data compiled by FAO's Land and Water Division (NRL); the monitoring and analysis will be under the responsibility of the Forest Conservation and Management Division and in particular of the Mountain Partnership Secretariat.","The index derives most of the information from GLC-SHARE, so their reliability and potential coverage are highly interrelated. \nGLC-SHARE (v. 1.0): ""The Global Land Cover-SHARE (GLC-SHARE) is a new land cover database at the global level created by FAO's Land and Water Division in partnership and with contribution from various partners and institutions. It provides a set of eleven major thematic land cover layers resulting from a combination of ""best available"" high resolution national, regional and/or sub-national land cover databases. The database is produced with a resolution of 30 arc-second2 (~1sqkm). The GLC-SHARE 2012 BetaRelease 1.0 is published by FAO in 2014. Complete free and open access to the data and metadata products are available at FAO GeoNetwork (www.fao.org/geonetwork).""\nThanks to the way GLC-SHARE is structured, the Mountain Green Cover Index has a global coverage and it is possible to compute the indicator at the global, regional, national and sub-national level. In addition, the indicator allows for an analysis across the different mountain elevation classes.

15.5,TRUE,15,http://unstats.un.org/sdgs/files/metadata-compilation/Metadata-Goal-15.pdf,11,"Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity, and, by 2020, protect and prevent the extinction of threatened species.",15.5.1,Índice de la Lista Roja,IUCN,,"Definition \nThe Red List Index is a multi-purpose indicator which measures the aggregate change in extinction risk across groups of species. It is based on the number of species in each category of extinction risk on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This indicator is expressed as an index ranging from 0 to 1. \nConcepts \nThreatened species are those listed on The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species in the categories Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered (i.e., species that are facing a high, very high, or extremely high risk of extinction in the wild in the medium-term future). Changes over time in the proportion of species threatened with extinction are largely driven by improvements in knowledge and changing taxonomy. The IUCN Red List Index (RLI) therefore accounts for such changes to yield a more informative indicator than the simple proportion of threatened species. It measures change in aggregate extinction risk across groups of species over time, resulting from genuine improvements or deteriorations in the status of individual species. It can be calculated for any representative set of species that have been assessed for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species at least twice.","The IUCN RLI is calculated at a point in time by first multiplying the number of species in each Red List Category by a weight (ranging from 1 for 'Near Threatened' to 5 for 'Extinct' and 'Extinct in the Wild') and summing these values. This is then divided by a maximum threat score which is the total number of species multiplied by the weight assigned to the 'Extinct' category. This final value is subtracted from 1 to give the IUCN RLI value. \n\n see report for mathematical calculation expression \n\n The formula requires that: \n\tExactly the same set of species is included in all time periods, and \n\tThe only Red List Category changes are those resulting from genuine improvement or deterioration in status (i.e., excluding changes resulting from improved knowledge or taxonomic revisions), and \n\tData Deficient species be excluded. \nIn many cases, species lists will change slightly from one assessment to the next (e.g., owing to taxonomic revisions). The conditions can therefore be met by retrospectively adjusting earlier Red List categorizations using current information and taxonomy. This is achieved by assuming that the current Red List Categories for the taxa have applied since the set of species was first assessed for the Red List, unless there is information to the contrary that genuine status changes have occurred. Such information is often contextual (e.g., relating to the known history of habitat loss within the range of the species). If there is insufficient information available for a newly added species, it is not incorporated into the IUCN RLI until it is assessed for a second time, at which point earlier assessments are retrospectively corrected by extrapolating recent trends in population, range, habitat and threats, supported by additional information. To avoid spurious results from biased selection of species, RLIs are typically calculated only for taxonomic groups in which all species worldwide have been assessed for the Red List, or for samples of species that have been systematically or randomly selected.","The world's species are impacted by a number of threatening processes, including habitat destruction and degradation, overexploitation, invasive alien species, human disturbance, pollution and climate change. This indicator can be used to assess overall changes in the extinction risk of groups of species as a result of these threats and the extent to which threats are being mitigated. \nThe IUCN RLI value ranges from 1 (all species are categorized as 'Least Concern') to 0 (all species are categorized as 'Extinct'). An intermediate value indicates how far the set of species has moved overall towards extinction. Thus, the IUCN RLI allows comparisons between sets of species in both their overall level of extinction risk (i.e., how threatened they are on average), and in the rate at which this risk changes over time. A downward trend in the IUCN RLI over time means that the expected rate of future species extinctions is worsening (i.e., the rate of biodiversity loss is increasing). An upward trend means that the expected rate of species extinctions is abating (i.e., the rate of biodiversity loss is decreasing), and a horizontal line means that the expected rate of species extinctions is remaining the same, although in each of these cases it does not mean that biodiversity loss has stopped. An upward IUCN RLI trend would indicate that the SDG Target 15.5 of reducing the degradation of natural habitats and protecting threatened species is on track towards halting the loss of biodiversity and thus preventing the extinction of threatened species by 2020. An IUCN RLI value of 1 would indicate that biodiversity loss has been halted. \nThe name ""Red List Index"" should not be taken to imply that the indicator is produced as a composite indicator of a number of disparate metrics, in the same way that, e.g., the Multidimensional Poverty Index is compiled. Rather, the RLI is an indicator of trends in species' extinction risk, as measured using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, and is compiled from data on changes over time in the Red List Category for each species, excluding any changes driven by improved knowledge or revised taxonomy.",,,,,,,"National agencies producing IUCN RLI data include non-governmental organisations (NGOs), government, and academic institutions working jointly and separately. Data are gathered from published and unpublished sources, species experts, scientists, and conservationists through correspondence, workshops, and electronic fora. Data are submitted by national agencies to IUCN, or are gathered through initiatives of the IUCN Red List Partnership, which includes: BirdLife International; Botanic Gardens Conservation International; Conservation International; Microsoft; NatureServe; Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; Sapienza University of Rome; Texas A&M University; Wildscreen; and Zoological Society of London. \nMost countries of the world have initiated programmes to assess the status of their species using IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria. These countries will be able to implement the IUCN RLI based on national extinction risk, once they have carried out at least two national Red Lists using the IUCN system in a consistent way. An increasing number of countries have now completed national RLIs for a range of taxa.",,,"This indicator can be disaggregated by ecosystems, habitats, countries and other political and geographic divisions, taxonomic subsets (e.g., families), suites of species relevant to particular international treaties or legislation, by species that are exposed to particular threatening processes or that deliver particular ecosystem services, or by biological or life-history traits. In each case, information can be obtained from The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species to determine which species are relevant to particular subsets (e.g. which occur in particular ecosystems, habitats, and geographic areas of interest). \nTrends for disaggregated RLIs are typically calculated by excluding genuine status changes (Red List category changes) that were driven by processes operating outside the ecosystem/habitat/country. \nDisaggregations of particular relevance as indicators towards SDG targets include: \nSDG 2.4\t Red List Index (species used for food and medicine); a disaggregation of the IUCN RLI used by the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership as an indicator towards Aichi Target 14 http://www.bipindicators.net/foodandmedicine. \nSDG 2.5\t Red List Index (wild relatives and local breeds); the assessment of wild relatives and local breeds of domesticated animals and plants would allow the derivation of this indicator as a disaggregation of the IUCN RLI modifying that used by the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership as an indicator towards Aichi Target 13 www.bipindicators.net/domesticatedanimals. \nSDG 12.2\t Red List Index (impacts of utilisation); a disaggregation of the IUCN RLI used by the Biodiversity Indicators Partnership as an indicator towards Aichi Target 4 www.bipindicators.net/redlistindexforbirdsmammalsandamphibians.

The staff of the IUCN Global Species Programme compile, validate, and curate these data, and are responsible for publishing and communicating the results. \nRed List assessments are made, either through open workshops or open-access web-based discussion fora. Assessments are reviewed by the appropriate Red List Authority (an individual or organization appointed by the IUCN SSC to review assessments for specific species or groups of species) to ensure standardization and consistency in the interpretation of information and application of the criteria. A Red List Technical Working Group and the IUCN Red List Unit work to ensure consistent categorization between species, groups and assessments. Finally, a Standards and Petitions Sub-committee monitors the process and resolves challenges and disputes over Red List assessments. The IUCN RLI can be applied at global, regional, and national scales. Global IUCN RLIs are based on repeated assessments of species' extinction risk at the global scale. While they can be disaggregated to show trends for species at smaller spatial scales, the reverse is not true. National or regional IUCN RLIs cannot be aggregated to produce IUCN RLIs showing global trends. This is because a taxon's global extinction risk has to be evaluated at the global scale and cannot be directly determined from multiple national scale assessments across its range (although the data from such assessments can be aggregated for inclusion in the global assessment). The IUCN publishes guidelines on applying the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria at regional or national scales. If all species within a particular region or country have been assessed at least twice using the IUCN approach, an IUCN RLI can be calculated from national data. \nThe global IUCN Red List is updated annually. IUCN RLIs for any sets of species that have been comprehensively reassessed in that year are usually released alongside the update of the IUCN Red List. Data stored and managed in the IUCN Red List database (IUCN's Species Information Service, SIS) are made freely available for non-commercial use through the IUCN Red List website.","There are four main sources of uncertainty associated with IUCN RLI values and trends. \n\t(a) Inadequate, incomplete or inaccurate knowledge of a species' status. This uncertainty is minimized by assigning estimates of extinction risk to categories that are broad in magnitude and timing. \n\t(b) Delays in knowledge about a species becoming available for assessment. Such delays apply to a small (and diminishing) proportion of status changes, and can be overcome in the IUCN RLI through back-casting. \n\t(c) Inconsistency between species assessments. These can be minimized by the requirement to provide supporting documentation detailing the best available data, with justifications, sources, and estimates of uncertainty and data quality, which are checked and standardized by IUCN through Red List Authorities, a Red List Technical Working Group and an independent Standards and Petitions Sub-committee. Further, detailed Guidelines on the Application of the Categories and Criteria are maintained, as is an online training course (in English, Spanish and French). \n\t(d) Species that are too poorly known for the Red List Criteria to be applied are assigned to the Data Deficient category, and excluded from the calculation of the IUCN RLI. For birds, only 0.8 per cent of extant species are evaluated as Data Deficient, compared with 24 per cent of amphibians. If Data Deficient species differ in the rate at which their extinction risk is changing, the IUCN RLI may give a biased picture of the changing extinction risk of the overall set of species. The degree of uncertainty this introduces can be estimated through a bootstrapping procedure that randomly assigns each Data Deficient species a category based on the numbers of non-Data Deficient species in each Red List category for the set of species under consideration, and repeats this for 1,000 iterations, plotting the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles as lower and upper confidence intervals for the median. \nThe main limitation of the IUCN RLI is related to the fact that the Red List Categories are relatively broad measures of status, and the IUCN RLI can practically be updated at intervals of at least four years. The IUCN RLI captures trends in one particular aspect of biodiversity: the rate at which species are moving towards or away from extinction. However, biodiversity encompasses a much wider spectrum, from genes, through populations and species, to ecosystems. In addition, the IUCN RLI does not capture particularly well the deteriorating status of common species that are declining slowly as a result of general environmental degradation.","There are no direct gender equity issues associated with the IUCN RLI. However, it is essential to recognise that women play a central role in the conservation, management and use of biodiversity. In many rural areas of developing countries, women's daily tasks are often tied closely to biodiversity. They are often responsible for gathering edible wild plants (fruits, leaves and roots of native plants) to feed their families as a supplement to agricultural grains, especially during unfavourable situations such as famine, conflicts and epidemics. Women often also gather medicinal plants, firewood and other bush products for medicine, fuel, house-building, paint and even manure and pesticide. Women's knowledge of biodiversity is immense and broad, because their communities' well-being depends on it, and preservation of this knowledge is crucial for maintaining biodiversity. Yet, their contribution is often overlooked. They are typically ""invisible"" partners from grassroots to policy level. There is therefore an urgent need to consider gender issues in development efforts, to promote true partnership and ensure the sustainable conservation and use of biodiversity.",,,"BAILLIE, J. E.

The rates of intentional homicide and conflict-related deaths should be reported separately, as combining them into one single indicator would risk conflating two distinct phenomena with differing root causes as well as varying levels of precision in measurement. Still, they are useful complements to each other as, by construction, they are exclusive and non-overlapping (ie. By design, their conjunction does not double count violent deaths). Intentional homicide is defined as the unlawful death inflicted upon a person with the intent of cause death or serious injury (Source: International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes (ICCS), 2015). ICCS recommends that intentional homicides include: \n\tMurder \n\tHonour killing \n\tSerious assault leading to death \n\tDeath as a result of terrorist activities \n\tDowry-related killings \n\tFemicide \n\tInfanticide \n\tVoluntary manslaughter \n\tExtrajudicial killings \n\tKillings caused by excessive force by law enforcement/state officials \nConflict-related deaths refer to those deaths caused by warring parties, including, but not limited to, those caused by traditional battlefield fighting and bombardments (battle-related deaths). The term conflict-related death is broader than the term ""battlerelated death"" as it includes killings that amount to war crimes, such as targeting of civilians or of military 'hors combat', killings associated with a conflict (but not accompanied by a battle between warring parties) such as one-sided killings, pogroms and genocides. Following the ICCS definition (see homicides at left) death as a result of terrorist activities would be included in intentional homicides. For both intentional homicides and conflict-related deaths, rates are defined as the total count in deaths in a calendar year, respectively, divided by the total resident population for the year, expressed per 100,000 population. The denominator (100,000 population) has been adopted globally by law enforcement as the standard for comparable measurement.",,"From UNODC:\nThis indicator is widely used at national and international level to measure the most extreme form of violent crime and it also provides a direct indication of lack of security. Security from violence is a pre-requisite for individuals to enjoy a safe and active life and for societies and economies to develop freely. Intentional homicides occur in all countries of the world and this indicator has a global applicability. Monitoring intentional homicides is necessary to better assess their causes, drivers and consequences and, in the longer term, to develop effective preventive measures. \nIf data are properly disaggregated (as suggested in the ICCS), the indicator can identify the different type of violence associated with homicide: inter-personal (including partner and family-related violence), crime (including organized crime and other forms of criminal activities) and political (including terrorism, hate crime). \nThe interpretation of this indicator is straightforward also for non-specialised users.\n\n From Goal 16 TST Working Group: \n As described above, this composite indicator is comprised of two forms of violent deaths. Intentional homicides occur in all countries of the world and have global applicability, while conflict-related deaths occur in countries with ongoing conflicts/wars. Peace is a much broader concept than violent deaths, however, it is difficult to measure many aspects of peace (threats and the fear of violence, insecurity, and other forms of violence, including damages to persons and property). Deaths due to violence are universally and easily understood, are frequently monitored and are comparable with only minor discrepancies in interpretation, largely due to the finality of death. Monitoring intentional homicides is necessary to better assess their causes and consequences and, in the longer term, to develop effective prevention measures. It is based on statistical data routinely produced by law enforcement authorities and/or public health institutions, with a high degree of international comparability. Conflict-related deaths measure the direct impact of conflicts on populations in terms of losses of life.",,,,,,,"From UNODC:\nTwo separate sources exist at country level: a) criminal justice system; b) public health/civil registration. UNODC collects and publishes data from criminal justice systems through its long-lasting annual data collection mandated by the UN General Assembly (UN Crime Trends Survey, UN-CTS); WHO collects and publishes data produced by public health/civil registration. \nUNODC and WHO are working together to harmonize data and procedures to produce joint UNODC-WHO homicide estimates at country, regional and global level. \nConsidering data collected by both UNODC and WHO, national data on homicide are available for 174 countries (at least one data point between 2009-2013) . Time series data on homicide suitable for monitoring are available for 141 countries (at least 3 data points, the most recent between 2011-2013). \nWhen national data on homicide are not available, estimates are produced by WHO.\n\n From Goal 16 TST Working Group: \n Sources for both components of the composite indicator vary, largely because intentional homicides are considered in the purview of law enforcement, whereas conflict-related deaths are typically a matter of state. \nOn intentional homicide, two separate sources exist at country level: a) criminal justice system; b) public health/civil registration. UNODC collects and publishes data from criminal justice systems through its annual data collection (UN Crime Trends Survey, UN-CTS); WHO collects and publishes data produced by public health/civil registration. Homicide data can be produced by two separate and independent sources and this can be used to assess accuracy of national data. Usually, for countries where data from both sources exist, a good level of matching between the sources is recorded (see UNODC Global Study on Homicide, 2013). Considering data collected by both UNODC and WHO, national data on homicide are available for 174 countries (at least one data point after 2009). Time series data on homicide suitable for monitoring are available for 141 countries (at least 3 data points, the most recent for 2011 or later).When national data on homicide are not available, estimates are produced by WHO. \nResearch projects like the Homicide Monitor (Igarape Institute) and the Global Burden of Armed Violence (Geneva Declaration) collect and report global data on intentional homicides. \nWhilst the global risk of violent death in armed conflict is generally lower than the global risk of death due to homicide, armed conflict can have deeper effects, destroying lives, livelihoods and substantial human costs, particularly in protracted internal conflict situations (see the Global Burden of Armed Violence, 2012, 2015). \nIn general, no national data sources exist on conflictrelated deaths, for a number of reasons. Often, normal registration systems are heavily affected by the presence of conflict. Additionally, actors on both sides of a conflict may have incentives for misreporting, deflating or inflating casualties. Estimates of conflict-related deaths, often displaying wide variations, are produced at international level: conflict death databases include the IISS Armed Conflict Database, the Armed Conflict Location and Event Database, the Correlates of War Project, the UCDP Battle-Related Deaths Dataset, and WHO estimates of deaths by cause. Data from these sources, though they may vary on estimates, exist for all major (>1000 battle deaths) and minor (>25 battle deaths per year) conflicts since 1945 (see UCDP). The Global Burden of Armed Violence (Geneva Declaration) compares and collects conflict-related deaths from multiple sources. \nAdditionally, at the local and regional level, observatories and other civil society initiatives provide data on conflict incidence and deaths. Ushahidi and CEWARN are two examples, though many more exist. \nThese initiatives can be, but need not be, the only way to monitor conflict-related deaths. They have proven working methodologies, that could be adopted by regional, international, multilateral, national or other actors.",,,"From UNODC:\nRecommended disaggregations for this indicator are: \n\tsex and age of the victim and the perpetrator \n\trelationship between victim and perpetrator(intimate partner, other family member, acquaintance, etc.) \n\tmeans of perpetration (firearm, blunt object, etc.) \n\tsituational context/motivation (organized crime, intimate partner violence, etc.).\n\n From Goal 16 TST Working Group: \nOn intentional homicide, possible disaggregation include: \n\tsex and age of victim and perpetrator \n\trelationship between victim and perpetrator (intimate partner, other family member, acquaintance, etc.) \n\tmeans of perpetration (firearm, blunt object, etc.) \n\tsituational context/motivation (organized crime, intimate partner violence, etc.) \n\tby region \n\tby population group \n\tby displacement and statelessness status. \nOn conflict-related-deaths, possible disaggregations include: \n\tsex and age of victim \n\tpopulation group of victim \n\tby location \n\tsex and age of perpetrator (where possible) \n\tmeans of death (firearm, explosive device, artillery/heavy weaponry, UAV, etc.) \n\tcivilian versus military status of victim.","At international level, data on intentional homicides are routinely collected and disseminated by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the World Health Organization. UNODC partners with regional organizations in the collection and dissemination of homicide data, respectively with Eurostat in Europe and with the Organisation of American States in the Americas.","From UNODC:\nThe ICCS provides important clarifications on the definition of intentional homicide. In particular, it states that the following killings are included in the count of homicide: \n\tMurder \n\tHonour killing \n\tSerious assault leading to death \n\tDeath as a result of terrorist activities \n\tDowry-related killings \n\tFemicide \n\tInfanticide \n\tVoluntary manslaughter \n\tExtrajudicial killings \n\tKillings caused by excessive force by law enforcement/state officials \nFurthermore, the ICCS provides indications on how to distinguish between intentional homicides, killings directly related to war/conflict and other killings that amount to war crimes. \nThe fact that homicide data are typically produced by two separate and independent sources at national level (criminal justice and public health) represents a specific asset of this indicator, as the comparison of the two sources is a tool to assess accuracy of national data. Usually, for countries where data from both sources exist, a good level of matching between the sources is recorded (see UNODC Global Study on Homicide, 2013). \nData on homicides produced by public health authorities are guided by the International classification of diseases (ICD-10), which is very similar to the definition of intentional homicide provided by the ICCS.\n\n From Goal 16 TST Working Group: \nMeasuring deaths and their attribution is not easy, but it can be done. \nICCS provides guidance on how to distinguish between intentional homicides, killings directly related to war/conflict and other killings that amount to war crimes. Data on homicides produced by public health authorities are guided by the International classification of diseases (ICD-10), which is very similar to the definition of intentional homicide provided by the ICCS. \nNon-intentional homicide is another crime that can provide information on violence prevalence. Though, it mostly refers to cases of killings due to negligent behaviours rather than to intentional violence. For nine countries where data are available, 95% of all non-intentional homicide are due to vehicular homicide.","From UNODC:\nWhen data are properly disaggregated, intentional homicide can be used to quantify gender-based killings, a relevant indicator to monitor violence against women.

These hazards cause grievous injury and death, impede peace operations, and hamper post-conflict reconstruction and development efforts. \nFindings from the M&E Mechanism for the UN Strategy 2013-2018 (UN M&E Mechanism) illustrate the deadly risk posed by mines/ERW in affected countries and territories in which the UN operates; in particular, the disproportionate impact of explosive hazards on the civilians who constitute more than half of the casualties from mines/ERW. The regular monitoring of mine/ERW casualty data through the global mechanism of the Sustainable Development Goals will significantly enhance the capacity of affected countries and territories including Member States, UN entities, and civil society to understand the scope of these threats and effectively mitigate the harms they cause.",,,,,,,"From Goal 16 TST Working Group, OHCHR:\nOn intentional homicide, two separate sources exist at country level: a) criminal justice system; b) public health/civil registration. UNODC collects and publishes data from criminal justice systems through its annual data collection (UN Crime Trends Survey, UN-CTS); WHO collects and publishes data produced by public health/civil registration. \nUNODC and WHO are working together to harmonize data and procedures to produce joint UNODC-WHO homicide estimates at country, regional and global level. \nConsidering data collected by both UNODC and WHO, national data on homicide are available for 174 countries (at least one data point after 2009) . Time series data on homicide suitable for monitoring are available for 141 countries (at least 3 data points, the most recent for 2011 or later).When national data on homicide are not available, estimates are produced by WHO. \nIn general, no national data sources exist on conflict-related deaths, as normal registration systems are heavily affected by war operations. Estimates of conflictrelated deaths, often displaying wide variations, are produced at international level: conflict death databases include the IISS Armed Conflict Database, the UCDP BattleRelated Deaths Dataset, PRIO Battle-Deaths Data and WHO estimates of deaths by cause.\n\n From United Nations Mine Action Service: \n Many member states affected by mines/ERW have casualty reporting systems in place. The most common, in use in 80% of mine action programmes globally, is the Information Management System for Mine Action (IMSMA).",,,"From Goal 16 TST Working Group, OHCHR:\nRecommended disaggregations for this indicator are: \n\tBy context (intentional homicide and conflict-related deaths) \nOn intentional homicide, possible disaggregations include: \n\tsex and age of victim and perpetrator \n\trelationship between victim and perpetrator(intimate partner, other family member, acquaintance, etc.) \n\tmeans of perpetration (firearm, blunt object, etc.) \n\tsituational context/motivation (organized crime, intimate partner violence, etc.) \n\tby region \n\tby population group \n\tby displacement and statelessness status. \nOn conflict-related-deaths, possible disaggregations include: \n\tsex and age of victim and perpetrator \n\tcivilian versus military status of victim.\n\n From United Nations Mine Action Service: \n Recommended disaggregation for this indicator: \n\tVictim sex and age (Man, Woman, Boy, Girl) \n\tDevice type (See below) \n\tVictim type (Civilian, Non-civilian, Operator) \nData from the M&E Mechanism for the UN Strategy for Mine Action 2013-2018 indicates that at least 86% of casualty data is available with sex and age disaggregation in participating countries and territories.","From Goal 16 TST Working Group, OHCHR:\nAt international level, data on intentional homicides are routinely collected and disseminated by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the World Health Organization. Several regional organizations collect and disseminate homicide data, especially in the Americas (OAS and IDB) and in Europe (Eurostat). Conflict death databases, at the international level, include the IISS Armed Conflict Database, the UCDP Battle-Related Deaths Dataset, and PRIO Battle-Deaths Data and WHO estimates of deaths by cause database. National level datasets exist for some countries.\n\n From United Nations Mine Action Service: \n The Landmine and Cluster Munitions Monitor provides several research products including annual reports on a variety of indicators related to mines, cluster munitions, and other ERW, including casualty data. The UN Interagency Working Group for Mine Action currently tracks casualty data in participating countries and territories as part of the M&E Mechanism for the UN Strategy for Mine Action 2013-2018.","The ICCS provides important clarifications on the exact definition of intentional homicide for statistical purposes. In particular, it states that the following killings need to be included in the count of homicide: \n\tMurder \n\tHonour killing \n\tSerious assault leading to death \n\tDeath as a result of terrorist activities \n\tDowry-related killings \n\tFemicide \n\tInfanticide \n\tVoluntary manslaughter \n\tExtrajudicial killings \n\tKillings caused by excessive force by law enforcement/state officials \nFurthermore, the ICCS provides indications on how to distinguish between intentional homicides, killings directly related to war/conflict and other killings that amount to war crimes. \nHomicide data can be produced by two separate and independent sources and this can be used to assess accuracy of national data. Usually, for countries where data from both sources exist, a good level of matching between the sources is recorded (see UNODC Global Study on Homicide, 2013). \nData on homicides produced by public health authorities are guided by the International classification of diseases (ICD-10), which is very similar to the definition of intentional homicide provided by the ICCS. \nData on conflict-related deaths are characterised by large variability due to uncertainty of estimates.","From Goal 16 TST Working Group, OHCHR:\nWhen properly disaggregated, intentional homicide can be used to quantify genderbased killings, a relevant indicator to monitor violence against women. Currently, 68 countries have reported homicide data disaggregated by type of perpetrator to UNODC (at least one data point after 2009).\n\n From United Nations Mine Action Service: \n Findings from the UN M&E Mechanism align with findings from other research demonstrating the disproportionate impact of mins/ERW on boys and men. Boys and men constitute 91% of mine/ERW casualties in countries participating in the M&E Mechanism. This trend is consistent across civilians, non-civilians, and operators; and it is mirrored across age and gender distribution data among beneficiaries of victim assistance services.",,"From Goal 16 TST Working Group, OHCHR:\nAt global level, intentional homicide is the most prevalent type of violent death. In 2012, the ratio between victims of conflict/war and victims of intentional homicide varied between one to five to one to ten (uncertainty due to variability of estimates of deaths related to war/conflict produced respectively by WHO and Uppsala Conflict Data Program). \nNon-intentional homicide is another crime that can provide information on violence prevalence. Though, it mostly refers to cases of killings due to negligent behaviours rather than to intentional violence. For nine countries where data are available, 95% of all non-intentional homicide are due to vehicular homicide. As situations of conflict affect a limited number of countries at a given time, the indicator is relevant for certain country contexts.\n\n From United Nations Mine Action Service: \n Different types of devices which cause death/injury: \n\tAntipersonnel mines \n\tAntivehicle mines \n\tAbandoned explosive ordnance (AXO) \n\tUnexploded ordnance (UXO) \n\tVictim-activated improvised explosive devices (IEDs).","From Goal 16 TST Working Group, OHCHR:\nUNODC, Global Study on Homicide 2011; UNODC, Global Study on Homicide 2013; WHO-UNDP-UNODC, Global Status Report on Violence Prevention 2014; \nIgarape Institute, Homicide Monitor, 2015 (http://homicide.igarape.org.br/ ); UNODC, International Classification of Crime for Statistical Purposes, 2015\n\n From United Nations Mine Action Service: \n \nThe Monitoring & Evaluation Mechanism for the UN Strategy for Mine Action 2013-2018. \nThe Landmine and Cluster Munitions Monitor (http://www.the-monitor.org/en-gb/home.aspx) \nGeneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining (http://www.gichd.org/)",,,,,,,,,United Nations Mine Action Service,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs (The United Nations Protocol to Prevent Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children, which is supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime). \nThe number of victims is defined as the number of detected and estimated number of non-detected adult women and men and girls and boys (18-) who have been trafficked for different forms of trafficking in persons. The estimated ratio between the number of detected victims and the estimated number of non-detected victims can be used to estimate the total number of human trafficking victims at national, regional and global levels. In addition, the ratio can be used to measure the efficiency of countries to detect trafficking victims. \n\n From Goal 16 TST Working Group: \n This is an outcome indicator derived from administrative data. The indicator is computed as the total number of identified victims of trafficking divided by population (per 100,000 persons). This indicator directly measures exploitation and trafficking, which are inadequately captured by the other proposed indicators. These human rights abuses affect both adults and children, and States have existing obligations to prevent them for both population groups.",,"From UNODC and OHCHR: \n Human trafficking for different forms of exploitation represents a major violation of victim's human rights, dignity and inclusion to the society. It has an impact on a person's health and opportunities, it creates economic inequalities and it is a threat to the personal security. The regular production of figures on this indicator will allow the monitoring of the impact of the anti-trafficking measures to the level of trafficking at national, regional and global levels. It also helps to assess the capacity of countries to detect and consequently support victims of trafficking. It will raise awareness on the most prevalent forms of trafficking in persons in different parts of the world. \n\n From Goal 16 TST Working Group: \n Trafficking in persons is a universal form of modern-day slavery. Trafficked persons are often victims of physical, sexual and psychological violence. The demand for cheap labour and sexual services, coupled with criminal practices that seek to profit from the exploitation of vulnerable people, is its main driver. Addressing this most egregious violation of human rights would significantly contribute to one of the main priorities of post-2015 namely to ""leave no one behind"" and has its legal basis in the UN Convention on Transnational Organized Crime and the optional protocol on human trafficking.",,,,,,,"From UNODC and OHCHR: \n Currently, the available and country specific number of detected victims is collected yearly from the Member States using a specific questionnaire. It is published in the UNODC biennial Global Report on Trafficking in Persons. Data are available for about 130 countries, since 2007. The data is disaggregated for age, sex and forms of exploitation. The estimated number of non-detected victims can be established by applying methodologies developed to measure the estimated number of different hidden populations (e.g. Respondent Driven Sampling and Network Scale-up Method). These methodologies have been tested with different forms of trafficking in persons. \n\n From Goal 16 TST Working Group: \n A primary data source will be administrative and judicial records maintained by competent national authorities, which may include police, labour inspectors, health care providers, educational institutions, national human rights institutions and ombudspersons, as well as civil society organizations.

Selected data on specific forms of trafficking in persons are collected and disseminated by ILO, UNICEF and UNHCR. Regional and geographically defined data is collected by IOM and some regional organizations such as EU. The Academia has developed a list of local studies assessing the hidden part of trafficking for specific geographical areas and forms of exploitation. \n\n From Goal 16 TST Working Group: \n At the international level, the ILO compiles data on trafficking, slavery, exploitation and forced labour. Data on trafficked persons is published by UNODC in its biennial Global Report on Trafficking in Persons, and in the IOM Human Trafficking Database.","From UNODC and OHCHR: \n In 2013 and 2014, UNODC has conducted two Expert Group Meetings with the academia on measuring different hidden populations. The work has resulted in a methodology to measure the hidden part of trafficking in persons in order to estimate the number of non-detected victims of trafficking. The methodology has been used in some studies and will be soon tested by UNODC. \n\n From Goal 16 TST Working Group: \n As it relies upon reports of individual events, this indicator may not be fully reliable. It may underestimate (or sometimes, though more rarely, overestimate) the true number of victims. These human rights abuses are, by their nature, hidden and in most instances, the number of cases reported will depend on awareness of victims of their rights, access to information, motivation and perseverance of civil society organizations and the media. \nData are compiled separately for each human rights abuse and aggregated. In order to reduce the total number of global indicators, this indicator is proposed to monitor targets 5.2 (violence against women), 8.7 (elimination of the worst forms of child labour and forced labour), 16.1 (violence), 16.2 (violence against children) and 16.4 (organised crime). Organized crime often includes significant human rights abuses, including trafficking, slavery, exploitation and forced labour, against both children and adults. Victims of such crimes are among the most invisible in official statistics, so it is vital that these abuses are monitored within the SDG framework to ensure that no one is left behind.","From UNODC and OHCHR: \n Trafficking in persons has a negative impact particularly on women. Currently, 70 % of detected victims of trafficking in persons are female: adult women (49%) and girls (21%).

They include legally earned value, money and monetized instruments that are transferred illicitly or value, money and monetized instruments that are acquired through illegal activities, such as the proceeds of crimes, including corruption and tax evasion. They can also capture tax avoidance and trade misinvoicing. \nAlthough the UN Economic Commission for Africa, UNDP, Global Financial Integrity and others have produced global country-by-country estimates for illicit financial flows, more work on methodologies would be required. \nOverview of the main methods of estimating illicit financial flows (adapted from the Mbeki Report of the High-level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows from Africa (http://www.uneca.org/iff)): In terms of the methodologies used to estimate IFFs, several empirical models have been used to estimate both the magnitude of IFFs and their economic implications for developing countries. These models and the analytic methods underlying them deserve further scrutiny. In particular, four methods have dominated the empirical literature: the Hot Money Method, the Dooley Method, the World Bank Residual Method and the IMF Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS)'based Trade Mispricing Method. The latter two remain the most widely used. The Hot Money Method records IFFs through net errors and omissions in payment balances. The Dooley Method relies on the privately held foreign assets reported in the balance of payments that do not generate investment income. The World Bank Residual Method estimates IFFs as the difference between the source of funds (external debt and foreign direct investment) and the use of funds (current account deficit and reserves). The Trade Mispricing Model assesses IFFs by looking for disparities arising from overinvoicing of imports and underinvoicing of exports after adjusting for ordinary price differences. In this model, imports are generally recorded after adjusting for the cost of insurance and freight, while exports are usually valued free-on-board. To provide the most thorough estimates of IFFs, Global Financial Integrity has combined the World Bank Residual Method and the Trade Mispricing Model in its computations. ECA has used the Trade Mispricing Model (see Mbeki report). \nAn Overview of the Analytical Methodologies Utilized by Global Financial Integrity to Study Illicit Financial Flows (adapted from their website: http://www.gfintegrity.org/issues/illicit-financial-flows-analytical-methodologies-utilizedglobal-financial-integrity/): Global Financial Integrity (GFI) estimates that nearly US$1 trillion of unrecorded money flows out of developing countries annually. There are three forms of unrecorded money moving across borders: \n\tCorrupt: Proceeds of bribery and theft by government officials. \n\tCriminal: Proceeds of drug trading, human trafficking, counterfeiting, contraband, and myriad forms of additional activities. \n\tCommercial: Proceeds arising from import and export transactions conducted so as to manipulate customs duties, VAT taxes, income taxes, excise taxes, or other sources of government revenues. \nIn analyzing IFFs, GFI utilizes sources of data and analytical methodologies that have been used by international institutions, governments, and economists for decades. Basically, these data sources and methodologies are providing information on gaps'gaps in balance of payments data and gaps in trade data. Where recorded sources and uses of funds in balance of payments data do not match, the difference is net errors and omissions, indicating an inflow or outflow that was not recorded. Where bilateral trade data does not match (after adjusting for freight and insurance in the data of the importing country) this indicates reinvoicing of transactions between export from one country and import into another country. Some reviewers of GFI's data sources and analytical methodologies have raised questions, which GFI is pleased to address as follows: \n\tGFI well recognizes that statistics can be flawed, due to errors in collection, recording, or conveying. Precisely the same point can be made about virtually every other economic analysis ever undertaken. GFI uses the best data available, data that has been collected, reported, and recorded by governments for decades according to international guidelines issued by the IMF. \n\tThe reliability and accuracy of trade statistics of developing countries are regularly assessed through the IMF's Data Quality Assessment Framework under the Data component of the Reports on Standards and Codes. These ratings show that for all assessed developing countries (about 72) the quality is ""very high"" or ""high"". \n\tGFI does not suggest that every single unrecorded transaction is illicit; however, the vast majority of unrecorded transactions are illicit. \n\tGFI does not use net illicit outflows and illicit inflows. In countries where unrecorded outflows and unrecorded inflows roughly balance, it would be a mistake to consider that such a country has no problem with unrecorded flows. There is no such concept as ""net crime."" Indeed, in GFI's view, illicit outflows and illicit inflows should be added, since both sides of the equation generally produce harm. \n\n From UNODC: \n There is no single, agreed definition of illicit financial flows (IFF), but essentially these are financial flows generated by methods, practices and crimes aiming to transfer financial capital in contravention of national or international laws. When anlyzing IFF the following components are generally included: proceeds of crime, proceeds of corruption (national or international corruption), money laundering (including from proceeds of crime), tax evasion, theft of state assets, and market and regulatory abuses.",,"From Goal 16 TST Working Group and OHCHR: \n The indicator measures an important aspect of target 16.4.

It does not include trade in intangibles, services, licenses, royalties, etc., now estimated to comprise more than 25 percent of all global trade. \n\tDOTS data reveals only transactions that have been re-invoiced between export and import. It does not reveal transactions where price manipulations have been included in the same invoice exchanged between exporters and importers. \nNone of the data sources adequately reveal cash transactions across borders, particularly those used in criminal pursuits. http://www.gfintegrity.org/issues/data-by-country/ \n\n From UNODC: \n A global repository of IFF data is not currently available. Some national or global estimates for the volume of illicit financial flows may exist, such as those compiled by the NGO Global Financial Integrity, but these are quite controversial. To establish a global indicator of illicit financial flows, methodologies would have to be further refined and a common definition agreed upon.",,,"From Goal 16 TST Working Group and OHCHR: \n Data could be disaggregated, depending on the methodology, to IFFs resulting from trade misinvoicing and other means of transfers. \n\n From UNODC: \n The indicator can have a higher political relevance if it is disaggregated by the broad components which source IFF: \n\tOrganized crime activities \n\tCorruption \n\tTax evasion \n\tOther criminal or administrative offences",From Goal 16 TST Working Group and OHCHR: \n Data is estimate country-by-country and can be aggregated to reginal and global levels.,,,,,Global Financial Integrity (http://www.gfintegrity.org/issues/data-by-country/) \nMbeki Report of the High-level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows from Africa (http://www.uneca.org/iff)),,,,,,,,,UNODC,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Civil registration administrative data could be linked to estimates of the expected number of newborns. In countries with deficient CRVS systems, data is collected via household surveys (DHS and MICS). Questions are asked about registration status of children born in the five years preceding the data of the survey. The numerator of this indicator includes children whose birth certificate was seen by the interviewer or whose mother or care-taker says the birth has been registered. Data are also often presented for other age groups such as infants or children under 5 years of age. \nMethod of estimation: currently UNICEF produces and publish estimates of birth registration for children under five using both CRVS and household surveys data.

Later in life, the lack of such documentation can mean that a child may enter into marriage or the labour market, or be conscripted into the armed forces, before the legal age. In adulthood, birth certificates may be required to obtain social assistance or a job in the formal sector, to buy or prove the right to inherit property, to vote and to obtain a passport. \n\n From Goal 16 TST Working Group: \nArticle 7 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) provides that all children should be registered immediately after birth and have the right from birth to a name and the right to acquire a nationality. Article 8 CRC further provides that, where a child is illegally deprived of some or all of the elements of his or her identity, States Parties shall provide appropriate assistance and protection, with a view to re-establishing speedily his or her identity. This indicator is therefore measured for all children, defined as persons under the age of 18. \nWhere births are not registered, children may be unable to obtain a birth certificate, which can result in denial of access to public services including education, health and social services, despite the human rights obligations of States to provide these without discrimination.

Torture means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity (Convention against Torture). Assault means physical attack against the body of another person resulting in serious bodily injury. \nHuman rights defenders is a term used to describe people who, individually or with others, act to promote or protect human rights. Human rights defenders are identified above all by what they do and it is through a description of their actions and of some of the contexts in which they work that the term can best be explained. The definition of human rights defenders may include journalists and trade unionists, but each individual case is counted only once. Other examples may include a student campaigning to end torture in prisons, a politician who takes a stand against endemic corruption or witnesses in court cases on human rights abuses. \nJournalists cover 'journalists, media workers and social media producers who generate a significant amount of public-interest journalism.' This concepualisation, has been agreed by UNESCO Member States, and could include a wide range of actors, including professional full-time reporters and analysts, foreign correspondents and local journalists, as well as bloggers and other social media producers who engage in forms of self-publication in print, on the Internet or elsewhere, journalists from 'traditional media' and those who work across multiple media. \nThe term ""trade unionist"" refers to an individual employed or accredited by a trade union, and other elected representatives of workers, including workers in the informal sector. \nThe indicator is calculated as the total number of reported cases of killing, disappearance, arbitrary detention, assault and torture of journalists, trade unionists or human rights defenders during the reporting period which are verified by an independent entity (in this case OHCHR and UNESCO).",,"Data on human rights violations committed against journalist, trade unionists and human rights defenders is required to know if fundamental freedoms, including the right to freedom of opinion and expression, which includes the right to receive information, and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association are protected in accordance with international law. The State is obliged to respect the human rights of all persons under its jurisdiction, in that it must refrain from infringement on rights, as well as an obligation to protect individuals against acts of third parties. The indicator therefore measures all such cases, but where the killing, disappearance, detention, assault or torture is perpetrated by an agent of the State or any other person acting under government authority or with its complicity, tolerance or acquiescence, or where the State fails to adequately investigate, punish or redress an offence committed by a third party, this will constitute a violation of human rights. \nKilling, disappearance, arbitrary detention, assault and torture of journalists, trade unionists or human rights defenders may have a chilling effect on freedom of expression and other fundamental freedoms. In order to have a full picture of the extent of protection of fundamental freedoms, it is advisable to also have a basket of indicators at national level including on access to information, other aspects of the rights to freedom of opinion and expression and freedom of assembly and association, notably the right to communicate with international human rights mechanisms, and other types of human rights violations often committed against journalists, trade unionists and human rights defenders, which may include intimidation, harassment, prosecution, defamation, and restricting mobility.",,,,,,,"This indicator collates data from multiple sources, including National Human Rights Institutions, national non-governmental organisations, associations of journalists, trades unions, ILO, and international non-governmental organisations including, for example Reporters without Borders, Article 19, and the Human Rights Observatory. Regional human rights Commissions, Courts and organisations also receive reports of such violations. \nInformation on the number of such violations committed against human rights defenders will be compiled annually by OHCHR from these data sources and further data collected through individual complaints to human rights treaty bodies, and Special Procedures of the Human Rights Council, including the Special Rapporteurs on human rights defenders, on freedom of opinion and expression, torture, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention. Additional data from OHCHR field offices and UN Country Teams will also be included. These data will be verified, cross-checked to ensure no duplication, and compiled in line with the agreed international definitions outlined above. \nInformation on the number of journalists killed are compiled annually by UNESCO, on a mandate by its Member States, from data collected through multi-sourced research, including press reports, information from monitoring groups, direct reports, and information from UNESCO field offices and other UN bodies. Reports of killings and impunity compiled by UNESCO are then transmitted for clarification on the status of judicial investigation to Member States and categorized into the following: 1) no information received so far; 2) ongoing; 3) resolved; 4) killed in cross-fire; and 5) others. This information can be found on an annual basis, within the reports by the UNESCO Director-General on 'The Safety of Journalists and the Danger of Impunity' and in the UNESCO study titled World Trends in Freedom of Expression and Media Development. \nUNESCO and OHCHR will serve as the lead agencies that will compile and validate data from these multiple sources. These agencies will develop a methodology of adjusting data taking into account data quality issues and to ensure the comparability of different data sources.",,,"The data on the indicator is disaggregated by type of violation, profession/area of work, ethnicity, sex, age, income, geographic location, disability, religion, migratory or displacement status, minority or indigenous status, sexual orientation and gender identity of the victim, and relevant characteristics of the perpetrator, where known (public official, private individual, agent of another entity, sex, age). The indicator could also distinguish on the basis of political opinion of the victim where this has been expressed.","UNESCO and OHCHR are the agencies responsible for compiling these indicators at the international level. This is a forward-looking indicator, for which full methodologies will be developed in the course of implementation of the SDGs. UNESCO and OHCHR will first publish data on killings, and then on the other human rights violations included in the indicator.","Estimates of the number of violations are particularly sensitive to the completeness of reporting of individual events. Such data may underestimate (or sometimes, though more rarely, overestimate) the true number of cases. In most instances, the number of cases reported will depend on the access to information, motivation and perseverance of civil society organizations and the media.","Women human rights defenders have faced all the types of violations included in this indicator. However, their particular situation and role require special awareness and sensitivity both to the ways in which they might be affected differently by such pressures and to some additional challenges. It is essential to ensure that women human rights defenders as well as men are protected and supported in their work and, indeed, that such women are fully recognized as human rights defenders.",,"While this indicator does not cover every aspect of this particular target, it does identify one of the most salient and measurable dimensions that impacts on the whole. Further, it is an indicator that draws upon existing UN agreements and mechanisms for data collection.","Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms: http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/SRHRDefenders/Pages/Declaration.aspx \nUnited Nations (2004).

It is not a composite indicator, but a logical linkage of laws and policies to practical impact that is relevant to SDG concerns. \nThe practical guarantee of public access may be partially assessed through dimensions such as those unpacked by The World Bank. In this way, the practical quality of legal provisions can be established by identifying if there are: 1) proactive disclosure provisions in laws that establish a legal duty to disclose; 2) mechanisms for citizens, firms, and others to request information that has not been proactively disclosed but that is relevant to their interests, 3) narrowly-tailored guidelines on exemptions to disclosure, and 4) institutional structures that support disclosure, such as information commissioners, oversight mechanisms, and complaints mechanisms. In some national cases, there is also information on the sources and numbers of requests and the response time taken to process these requests. \nUNESCO, within its mandate for the right to freedom of expression, which includes the corollary of the right to freedom of information, already monitors progress and issues in this area through its existing submissions to the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) and regularly issued research reports on World Trends on Freedom of Expression and Media Development, including its Media Development Indicators assessments.

NHRIs are State bodies with a constitutional and/or legislative mandate to protect and promote human rights. They are part of the State apparatus and are funded by the State. However, they operate and function independently from government. While their specific mandate may vary, the general role of NHRIs is to address discrimination in all its forms, as well as to promote the protection of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. Core functions of NHRIs include complaint handling, human rights education and making recommendations on law reform. Effective NHRIs are an important link between government and civil society, in so far as they help bridge the 'protection gap' between the rights of individuals and the responsibilities of the State. Six models of NHRIs exist across all regions of the world today, namely: Human rights commissions, Human rights ombudsman institutions, Hybrid institutions, Consultative and advisory bodies, Institutes and centres and multiple institutions. \nAn Independent NHRI is an institution with 'A level' accreditation status as benchmarked against the United Nations Paris Principles, which were adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 1993.1 The process of accreditation is conducted through peer review by the Sub-Committee on Accreditation (SCA) of the ICC. There are three possible types of accreditation: \nA: Compliance with Paris Principles \nB: Observer Status ' Not fully in compliance with the Paris Principles or insufficient information provided to make a determination \nC: Non-compliant with the Paris Principles \nAccreditation by the ICC entails a determination whether the NHRI is compliant, both in law and practice, with the Paris principles, the principal source of the normative standards for NHRIs, as well as with the General Observations developed by the SCA. \nOther international standards may also be taken into account by the SCA, including the provisions related to the establishment of national mechanisms in the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment as well as in the International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Likewise, the SCA looks at any NHRI-related recommendation from the international human rights mechanisms, notably, the Treaty Bodies, Universal Periodic Review (UPR) and special procedures. The process also looks into the effectiveness and level of engagement with international human rights systems. \nMethod of computation \nThe indicator is computed as the accreditation classification, namely A, B or C of the NHRI.",,"This indicator measures the global continual efforts of countries in setting up independent national institutions, through international cooperation, to promote inclusive, peaceful and accountable societies. The creation and fosterage of a NHRI indicates a State's commitment to promote and protect the human rights provided in international human rights instruments. Compliance with the Paris Principles vest NHRIs with a broad mandate, competence and power to investigate, report on the national human rights situation, and publicise human rights through information and education. While NHRIs are essentially state funded, they are to maintain independence and pluralism. When vested with a quasi-judicial competence, NHRIs handle complaints and assist victims in taking their cases to courts making them an essential component in the national human rights protection system. These fundamental functions that NHRIs play and their increasing participation in the international human rights fora make them important actors in the improvement of the human rights situation, including the elimination of discriminatory laws and the promotion and enforcement of non-discriminatory laws \nAt the national level reporting, the better the accreditation classification of the NHRI reflects that it is credible, legitimate, relevant and effective in promoting human rights at the national level.",,,,,,,"The main source of data on the indicator is administrative records of the SubCommittee on Accreditation reports of the ICC. OHCHR compiles the data into a global directory of NHRI status accreditation updated every six months, after the Subcommittee on Accreditation submits its report. This information can be accessed on a continuous basis, including through maps.",,,"While disaggregation of information is not applicable for this indicator, it may be desirable to highlight the type of NHRI, whether Ombudsman, human rights commission, advisory body, research-based institute, etc.",ICC and OHCHR are the agencies responsible for compiling these indicators at the international level.,"The UN Secretary General's (SG) reports to the Human Rights Council (HRC) (A/HRC/13/44) and to the General Assembly (A/65/340, highlighted the value of the overall human rights work by NHRIs and stated that, 'National human rights institutions compliant with the Paris Principles are key elements of a strong and effective national human rights protection system. They can help ensure the compliance of national laws and practices with international human rights norms; support governments to ensure their implementation; monitor and address at the national level core human rights concerns such as torture, arbitrary detention, human trafficking and human rights of migrants; support the work of human rights defenders; and contribute to eradicate all forms of discrimination', (A/HRC/13/44, par. 108). Cooperation and constructive relationship between NHRIs and the government, parliaments, civil society organisations and other national institutions with a role to promote and protect human rights is encouraged by the SG in his report to the HRC for 2010 (A/HRC/16/76). The important and constructive role of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights has also been acknowledged in different United Nations instruments and resolutions, including the Final Document and Programme of Action of the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, GA resolutions A/RES/63/172 (2008) and A/RES/64/161 (2009) on National institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights. In addition, creation and strengthening of NHRIs have also been encouraged. For example, the 1993 GA resolution 48/134 'affirms the priority that should be accorded to the development of appropriate arrangements at the national level to ensure the effective implementation of international human rights standards' while the 2008 GA resolution A/RES/63/169 encouraged states 'to consider the creation or the strengthening of independent and autonomous Ombudsman, mediator and other national human rights institutions'. The Human Rights Council (HRC resolution 5/1, 2007) also called for the effective participation of national human rights institutions in its institution building package, which provides elements to guide its future work. \nUN treaty bodies have also recognised the crucial role that NHRIs represent in the effective implementation of treaty obligations and encouraged their creation (e.g. CERD General Comment 17, A/48/18 (1993); CESCR General Comment 10, E/C.12/1998/25; and CRC General Comment 2, CRC/GC/2002/2). A compilation of various recommendations and concluding observations relevant to NHRIs emanating from the international human rights mechanisms in the United Nations is available at: http://www.universalhumanrightsindex.org/. \nThe ICC is an international association of NHRIs which promotes and strengthens NHRIs to be in accordance with the Paris Principles and provides leadership in the promotion and protection of human rights (ICC Statute, Art. 5). Decisions on the classifications of NHRIs are based on their submitted documents such as: 1) copy of legislation or other instrument by which it is established and empowered in its official or published format (e.g. statute, and /or constitutional provisions, and/or presidential decree, 2) outline of organisational structure including details of staff and annual budget, 3) copy of recent published annual report; 4) detailed statement showing how it complies with the Paris Principles. NHRIs that hold 'A' and 'B' status are reviewed every five years. Civil society organisations may also provide relevant information to OHCHR pertaining to any accreditation matter. \nAccreditation of NHRIs shows that the government supports human rights work in the country. However their effectiveness should also be measured based on their ability to gain public trust and the quality of their human rights work. In this context, it would also be worthwhile to look into the responses of the NHRI to the recommendations of the ICC. Likewise, the inputs from the NHRI while engaging with the international human rights mechanisms (i.e. submissions to the Human Rights Council, including UPR, and to the treaty bodies) represent a valuable source of information on how NHRIs carry out their mandate in reference to international human rights instruments.","NHRIs should have a clear mandate to examine and make recommendations on equality and non-discrimination, including on the ground of gender.",,,"Data for the indicator are available here: http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Countries/NHRI/Pages/NHRIMain.aspx \nMaps of the data are available here: http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/Indicators/Pages/HRIndicatorsIndex.aspx \nThe Paris Principles require NHRIs to: a) Protect human rights, including by receiving, investigating and resolving complaints, mediating conflicts and monitoring activities; and b) Promote human rights, through education, outreach, the media, publications, training and capacity building, as well as advising and assisting the Government.

A detailed description of the linkages between the GFS and the 2008 SNA categories of taxes is provided in Appendix 7 of the GFSM 2014.",,"Measures of tax burden are indicators of how well tax policy meets one of its primary goals, equitably raising the revenues needed to run government. Equity has two aspects. The first, vertical equity, concerns the way taxes are distributed among taxpayers with different abilities to pay. The second, horizontal equity, concerns the way taxes are distributed among taxpayers with the same ability to pay. Tax burden measures thus answer broad economic and social questions about the effect of tax policy on the distribution of income and wealth. \nThe distinction regarding national, state and/or local level government is important. For the purposes of monitoring this indicator, the central budget is seen as the focus (even if some of tax payments go to other jurisdictions). When decisions about resources are made, the budgetary central government is a key subsector of the general government sector of the economy. The general government sector consists of resident institutional units that fulfill the functions of government as their primary activity. In all countries, there is an institutional unit of the general government sector particularly important in terms of size and power, in particular the power to exercise control over many other units and entities. The budgetary central government is often a single unit of the central government that encompasses the fundamental activities of the national executive, legislative, and judiciary powers. This component of general government is usually covered by the main (or general) budget. The budgetary central government's revenue and expense are normally regulated and controlled by a ministry of finance, or its functional equivalent, by means of a budget approved by the legislature. Most of the ministries, departments, agencies, boards, commissions, judicial authorities, legislative bodies, and other entities that make up the budgetary central government are not separate institutional units. This is because they generally do not have the authority to own assets, incur liabilities, or engage in transactions in their own right (see GFSM 2014 Chapter 2). \nThere is a widespread acceptance ' in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and indeed in Agenda 2030 ' that multiple sources of finance will be needed to meet the SDGs, and that these will need to work together effectively. This includes a greater role for domestic resources in meeting national development goals, and for interventions in which public resources ' including ODA - strengthen domestic capacities for expanding their revenue bases. Indeed, especially in developing countries, vertical fiscal gaps will potentially widen as demands increase for higher public spending ' particularly in countries where there is significant pressure on central authorities to provide quality infrastructure and basic services. In many cases the execution of the budgetary central government's proposed budget is constrained by poor revenue administration and/or a lack of a statistical framework for monitoring revenue streams. Given unpredictable and fluctuating levels of revenue in many developing countries, improved revenue statistics will help mitigate any possible budget shortfalls and support the sustainable development of national economies.",,,,,,,"Revenue data: annual and sub-annual tax data in either GFS format or a national presentation that can be ""bridged"" to the GFS classifications are generally available from Ministry of Finance data. Such data refer to the six main GFS categories as indicated under Definition.",,,"It is suggested, based upon the complexity of data collection, standardised reporting, and cost implications that data should not be disaggregated below the level of detail presented in the GFSM 2014.",,"Key issues related to this indicator are (1) level of disaggregation of the six main GFS tax categories, (2) cost of linking national presentations to the GFS classification system, (3) data accuracy, and (4) cross-country comparability. Although the SNA and OECD Revenue Statistics may be utilised to determine the tax burden, ensuring cross-country comparability can best be achieved through the use of the GFSM 2014 classifications.",,,"Revenue Statistics, published annually by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the related database, although limited to OECD countries and a specific timeline, does provide a widely adopted and largely comparable methodology that can support addressing this indicator. This annual publication gives a conceptual framework to define which government receipts should be regarded as taxes. It presents a unique set of detailed and internationally comparable tax data in a common format for all OECD countries from 1965 onwards. \nIt should also be noted that the classification employed in OECD Revenue Statistics has two main differences from the GFSM 2014: Compulsory social security contributions are treated as taxes and the categories of taxes on goods and services, and taxes on international trade and transactions are combined into a single category. In addition, at a detailed classification level, Revenue Statistics differs in the following aspects: (i) payable tax credits are recorded as negative taxes to the extent that the payable tax credit off sets existing income tax receivable; (ii) imputed taxes or subsidies resulting from the central bank imposing a rate of interest other than the market rate are excluded from Revenue Statistics; and (iii) imputed taxes or subsidies resulting from the operation of multiple exchange rate systems are excluded from Revenue Statistics. \n\n see report for examples.","IMF, Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014 (GFSM 2014), assessed Dec 28 2015. \nOCED, Revenue Statistics and the related database, (http://www.oecd.org/ctp/tax-policy/revenue-statistics-19963726.htm), assessed Dec 28 2015.",16.6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

International postal and parcel flows would be a proxy for international e-commerce flows since the ecommerce ecosystem heavily relies on the international postal and express infrastructure to transport ecommerce-related shipments.",,"From ITC, UNCTAD, WTO:\nThe indicator is self-explanatory and measures precisely what is required by the target.\n\n From UPU: \n E-commerce is likely to represent a significant share of international trade transactions by 2030. In order to avoid an e-commerce divide between developing and developed countries, trade policies must fully take into account this irreversible phenomenon. Moreover, international e-commerce will play an essential development role for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the coming two decades, particularly for those interested in internationalizing their activities.",,,,,,,"From ITC, UNCTAD, WTO:\nData on goods trade is retrieved from ITC (Trade Map), WTO (IDB) and UNSD (COMTRADE) databases. For services trade, WTO, ITC, UNCTAD have harmonized their databases and are now providing the same information. \nThis indicator can generally be compiled around March of each year. At that time (say year y), the indicator is compiled for (y-2), corresponding to the availability of detailed bi-lateral trade flows.\n\n From UPU: \n The indicator can be estimated thanks to data available in UPU's international tracking systems for parcels and postal items enabling real-time analysis of billions of data records.",,,"From ITC, UNCTAD, WTO:\nThis indicator can be disaggregated and analysed by product sector, by geographical region and by level of development.\n\n From UPU: \n The possibility of accessing tracking systems data enables the maximal disaggregation level from a geographic perspective, with detailed information available for any location involved in international postal and parcels exchanges within a country. Moreover, the forthcoming systematic use of an electronic customs declaration system by UPU member countries will considerably enrich the data with product information at the most disaggregated HS classification level for international trade.",,"From ITC, UNCTAD, WTO:\nTo further refine the quality of the information, additional sub-measurement could be calculated including a) Exports of high technological content as proportion of total exports, b) Export diversification (by product; by market destination). This sub measurement can be calculated only for goods trade and not for services trade. \nSynergies could be created with target 8.2 (as a measurement of diversification, technological upgrading and innovation) and target 2.3 (to measure the increase of productivity of small scale food producers and the enhanced opportunities to access market and value addition segments). In terms of limitation, \n\tConcerning missing data for trade in goods (especially in the case of LDCs) ITC (Trade Map) uses mirror data to complete the information and UNCTAD provides systematic estimates. \n\tInformation on services trade is less detailed.\n\n From UPU: \n While international postal exchanges reflect the development of international e-commerce very well, a small number of international postal transactions represents exchanges between individuals only. However, the latter exchanges are typically not submitted to commercial customs declaration.",From UPU: \nThe proportion of male or female recipients of postal items could be estimated by sampling postal traffic in each country.,Data on goods trade is available for almost all countries and territories. \nData on services trade are available for almost 200 countries but bilateral data are scarcer and as well as information at the higher level of detail,"From UPU: \nPostal, parcel and express delivery networks are dealing with at least half a trillion economic transactions every year.

Agreement on these points should be sought during the next IAEG meeting. \nIn terms of limitations: \n\tTariffs are only part of the trade limitation factors, especially when looking at exports of developing or least developed countries under non-reciprocal preferential treatment, that set criteria for eligibility. Accurate estimates on non-tariff measures do not exist, thus the calculations on market access are limited to tariffs only. \n\tA full coverage of preferential schemes of developed countries has been used for the computation, but preferential treatment may not be fully used by developing countries' exporters for different reasons such as the inability of certain exporters to meet eligibility criteria (i.e., complying with rules of origin). \n\tThe indicator only addresses the tariff situation facing developing countries' exports and not their own tariff profiles, despite the fact that trade openness, by itself, is conducive to export promotion.",,"Concerning the feasibility rating, data is already available.",,,,,,,,,,,WTO,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
