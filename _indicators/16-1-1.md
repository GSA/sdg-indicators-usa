  From UNODC:

  This indicator is widely used at national and international level to measure
  the most extreme form of violent crime and it also provides a direct
  indication of lack of security. Security from violence is a pre-requisite for
  individuals to enjoy a safe and active life and for societies and economies to
  develop freely. Intentional homicides occur in all countries of the world and
  this indicator has a global applicability. Monitoring intentional homicides is
  necessary to better assess their causes, drivers and consequences and, in the
  longer term, to develop effective preventive measures. 

  If data are properly disaggregated (as suggested in the ICCS), the indicator
  can identify the different type of violence associated with homicide:
  inter-personal (including partner and family-related violence), crime
  (including organized crime and other forms of criminal activities) and
  political (including terrorism, hate crime). 

  The interpretation of this indicator is straightforward also for
  non-specialised users.

   From Goal 16 TST Working Group: 
   As described above, this composite indicator is comprised of two forms of violent deaths. Intentional homicides occur in all countries of the world and have global applicability, while conflict-related deaths occur in countries with ongoing conflicts/wars. Peace is a much broader concept than violent deaths, however, it is difficult to measure many aspects of peace (threats and the fear of violence, insecurity, and other forms of violence, including damages to persons and property). Deaths due to violence are universally and easily understood, are frequently monitored and are comparable with only minor discrepancies in interpretation, largely due to the finality of death. Monitoring intentional homicides is necessary to better assess their causes and consequences and, in the longer term, to develop effective prevention measures. It is based on statistical data routinely produced by law enforcement authorities and/or public health institutions, with a high degree of international comparability. Conflict-related deaths measure the direct impact of conflicts on populations in terms of losses of life.
