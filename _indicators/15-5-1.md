  The world's species are impacted by a number of threatening processes,
  including habitat destruction and degradation, overexploitation, invasive
  alien species, human disturbance, pollution and climate change. This indicator
  can be used to assess overall changes in the extinction risk of groups of
  species as a result of these threats and the extent to which threats are being
  mitigated. 

  The IUCN RLI value ranges from 1 (all species are categorized as 'Least
  Concern') to 0 (all species are categorized as 'Extinct'). An intermediate
  value indicates how far the set of species has moved overall towards
  extinction. Thus, the IUCN RLI allows comparisons between sets of species in
  both their overall level of extinction risk (i.e., how threatened they are on
  average), and in the rate at which this risk changes over time. A downward
  trend in the IUCN RLI over time means that the expected rate of future species
  extinctions is worsening (i.e., the rate of biodiversity loss is increasing).
  An upward trend means that the expected rate of species extinctions is abating
  (i.e., the rate of biodiversity loss is decreasing), and a horizontal line
  means that the expected rate of species extinctions is remaining the same,
  although in each of these cases it does not mean that biodiversity loss has
  stopped. An upward IUCN RLI trend would indicate that the SDG Target 15.5 of
  reducing the degradation of natural habitats and protecting threatened species
  is on track towards halting the loss of biodiversity and thus preventing the
  extinction of threatened species by 2020. An IUCN RLI value of 1 would
  indicate that biodiversity loss has been halted. 

  The name "Red List Index" should not be taken to imply that the indicator is
  produced as a composite indicator of a number of disparate metrics, in the
  same way that, e.g., the Multidimensional Poverty Index is compiled. Rather,
  the RLI is an indicator of trends in species' extinction risk, as measured
  using the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria, and is compiled from data on
  changes over time in the Red List Category for each species, excluding any
  changes driven by improved knowledge or revised taxonomy.

  Take urgent and significant action to reduce the degradation of natural
  habitats, halt the loss of biodiversity, and, by 2020, protect and prevent the
  extinction of threatened species.
indicator_definition: >-
  Definition The Red List Index is a multi-purpose indicator which measures the
  aggregate change in extinction risk across groups of species. It is based on
  the number of species in each category of extinction risk on The IUCN Red List
  of Threatened Species. This indicator is expressed as an index ranging from 0
  to 1. Concepts Threatened species are those listed on The IUCN Red List of
  Threatened Species in the categories Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically
  Endangered (i.e., species that are facing a high, very high, or extremely high
  risk of extinction in the wild in the medium-term future). Changes over time
  in the proportion of species threatened with extinction are largely driven by
  improvements in knowledge and changing taxonomy. The IUCN Red List Index (RLI)
  therefore accounts for such changes to yield a more informative indicator than
  the simple proportion of threatened species. It measures change in aggregate
  extinction risk across groups of species over time, resulting from genuine
  improvements or deteriorations in the status of individual species. It can be
  calculated for any representative set of species that have been assessed for
  The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species at least twice.
