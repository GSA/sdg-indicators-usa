actual_indicator_available_description: >-
  This table contains estimated volume numbers based on both the Federal Bureau
  of Investigation (FBI) Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program's legacy and
  revised definitions of rape. The data do not include other forms of violence
  other than rape. The data include all rapes reported to the FBI UCR Program
  and are not limited to intimate partner. In 2013, the FBI UCR Program
  initiated the collection of rape data under a revised definition and removed
  the term “forcible” from the offense name. Column heading Year - is the year
  the data represents. Column Heading Revised Rape Definitions are the estimates
  of data collected under the revised rape definition: Penetration, no matter
  how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral
  penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the
  victim. (This includes the offenses of rape, sodomy, and sexual assault with
  an object as converted from data submitted via the National Incident-Based
  Reporting System [NIBRS].) Column Heading Legacy Rape Definition are the
  estimates of data collected under the legacy rape definition: The carnal
  knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will Indicator data on sexual
  assault is available in the NIBRS; however, NIBRS currently represents less
  than 30% of the nation's population and nonresponse cannot be modeled to
  adjust for bias because statistical sampling methodologies were not used.
us_method_of_computation: >-
  Agencies submit data based on only one of these definitions. Within each
  population group size, the proportion of female rape victims was calculated
  from all NIBRS reports of rape, sodomy, and sexual assault with an object. For
  agencies that reported using the revised definition, the actual number of
  reported rapes was decreased by the calculated proportion to arrive at an
  estimate for the number of rapes using the legacy definition. Conversely, for
  agencies that reported using the legacy definition, the actual number of
  reported rapes was increased by the inverse of the proportion to arrive at an
  estimate for the number of rapes using the revised definition.
comments_and_limitations: >-
  The data do not include other forms of violence other than rape. The data
  include all rapes reported to the FBI UCR Program and are not limited to
  intimate partner. In 2013, the Summary UCR definition of rape was changed to
  “penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part
  or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the
  consent of the victim.” The new definition updated the 80-year-old historical
  definition of rape which was “carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and
  against her will.” Effectively, the revised definition expands rape to include
  both male and female victims and offenders, and reflects the various forms of
  sexual penetration understood to be rape, especially nonconsenting acts of
  sodomy, and sexual assaults with objects.
