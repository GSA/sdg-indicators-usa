  MDG target 7C called for 'sustainable access' to 'safe drinking water'. At the
  start of the MDG period, there was a complete lack of nationally
  representative data about drinking water safety in developing countries, and
  such data were not collected through household surveys or censuses. The JMP
  developed the indicator use of 'improved' water sources, which was used as a
  proxy for 'safe water', as such sources are likely to be protected against
  faecal contamination, and this metric has been used since 2000 to track
  progress towards the MDG target. International consultations since 2011 have
  established consensus on the need to build on and address the shortcomings of
  this indicator; specifically, to address normative criteria of the human right
  to water including accessibility, availability, and quality. 

  The above consultation concluded that JMP should go beyond the basic level of
  access and address safe management of drinking water services, including
  dimensions of accessibility, availability and quality. The proposed indicator
  of 'safely managed drinking water services' is designed to address this.

indicator_name: Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services
target: >-
  By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable
  drinking water for all.
indicator_definition: >-
  Population using a basic drinking water source ('improved' sources of drinking
  water used for MDG monitoring i.e. piped water into dwelling, yard or plot;
  public taps or standpipes; boreholes or tubewells; protected dug wells;
  protected springs and rainwater) which is located on premises and available
  when needed and free of faecal (and priority chemical) contamination.
method_of_computation:
  ? 'Household surveys and censuses currently provide information on types of basic drinking water sources listed above, and also indicate if sources are on premises. These data sources often have information on the availability of water and increasingly on the quality of water at the household level, through direct testing of drinking water for faecal or chemical contamination. These data will be combined with data on availability and compliance with drinking water quality standards (faecal and chemical) from administrative reporting or regulatory bodies. The WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) estimates access to basic services for each country, separately in urban and rural areas, by fitting a regression line to a series of data points from household surveys and censuses. This approach was used to report on use of ''improved water'' sources for MDG monitoring. The JMP is evaluating the use of alternative statistical estimation methods as more data become available. The accompanying Statistical Note describes in more detail how data on availability and quality from different sources, can be combined with data on use of different types of supplies, as recorded in the current JMP database to compute the proposed indicator. Predominant type of statistics'
  : national estimates adjusted for global comparison.
