method_of_computation: >-
  Number of children who died during the first 28 days of life / Number of live
  births Method of measurement Data from civil registration: The number of live
  births and the number of neonatal deaths are used to calculate age_ specific
  rates. This system provides annual data. Data from household surveys:
  Calculations are based on full birth history, whereby women are asked for the
  date of birth of each of their children, whether each child is still alive and
  if not the age at death. Method of estimation The United Nation Inter_agency
  Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN_IGME) produces neonatal mortality
  rate estimates with a Bayesian spline regression model which models the ratio
  of neonatal mortality rate / (under_five mortality rate'_'neonatal mortality
  rate). Estimates of NMR are obtained by recombining the estimates of the ratio
  with UN IGME_estimated under_five mortality rate. See UN IGME for more
  details. Predominant type of statistics: adjusted and estimated. These
  neonatal mortality rates have been estimated by applying methods to the
  available data from all Member States in order to ensure comparability across
  countries and time; hence they are not necessarily the same as the official
  national data.
indicator_definition: >-
  Probability that a child born in a specific year or period will die during the
  first 28 completed days of life if subject to age_specific mortality rates of
  that period, expressed per 1000 live births. Neonatal deaths (deaths among
  live births during the first 28 completed days of life) may be subdivided into
  early neonatal deaths, occurring during the first 7 days of life, and late
  neonatal deaths, occurring after the 7th day but before the 28th completed day
  of life.
target: >-
  By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age,
  with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as
  12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per
  1,000 live births.
