  Prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in the population, based on
  the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES)
target: >-
  By 2030, end hunger and ensure access by all people, in particular the poor
  and people in vulnerable situations, including infants, to safe, nutritious
  and sufficient food all year round.
indicator_definition: >-
  These are in reality two related indicators, representing the percentage of
  individuals in the national adult population (15 or more years of age) that
  have experienced moderate or severe levels and severe levels of food
  insecurity respectively, during the previous year.Severity of food insecurity
  is defined as the extent to which people have difficulties in accessing food
  of adequate quality and/or quantity due to lack of money or other resources.
  Difficulties include also psychological concerns associated with the struggle
  in accessing food.

  Household food insecurity as measured by the US Department of Agriculture's
  (USDA) Current Population Survey Food Security Supplement. 
actual_indicator_available_description: >-
  Food-insecure households had difficulty at some time during the year providing
  enough food for all their members due to a lack of resources. USDA's food
  insecurity statistics are similar in concept to those obtained with FAO's Food
  Insecurity Experience Scale. However, the threshold for food insecurity
  differs between the two data sources. FAO's measure of moderate or severe food
  insecurity is somewhat more severe than USDA's measure of food insecurity.
  Therefore, the prevalence of US food insecurity as measured by USDA is higher
  than the prevalence of US food insecurity as measured by FAO's Food Insecurity
  Experience Scale. FAO measures moderate or severe food insecurity among adults
  while USDA measures food insecurity among US households.

  USDA food security statistics are obtained from data collected in the Food
  Security Supplement to the Current Population Survey. The household food
  security statistics are based on a measure of food security calculated from
  responses to a series of questions about conditions and behaviors that
  characterize households when they are having difficulty meeting basic food
  needs. The US Household Food Security Survey Module includes three questions
  about food conditions of the household as a whole and seven about food
  conditions of adults in the household, and, if there are children in the
  household, an additional eight questions about their food conditions. The food
  security status of each interviewed household is determined by the number of
  food-insecure conditions and behaviors the household reports. Households are
  classified as food secure if they report no food-insecure conditions or only
  one or two food-insecure conditions. They are classified as food insecure if
  they report three or more food-insecure conditions. Households classified as
  food insecure were "at times unable to acquire adequate food for one or more
  household members because they had insufficient money and other resources for
  food". For more information on U.S. food security statistics and measurement
  methods see the resources available at:

comments_and_limitations: >-
  The FAO Food Insecurity Experience Scale-Survey Module and US Household Food
  Security Survey Module questions are similar and both rely on the underlying
  Rasch measurement model to determine food insecurity. Where FAO's and USDA's
  measures of  food insecurity differ is in the threshold for food insecurity.
  The internationally comparable threshold for \ FAO's measure of moderate or
  severe food insecurity is set at a more severe level of food insecurity than
  is USDA's threshold for U.S. food insecurity. Thus, the prevelance of food
  insecurity as measured by USDA methods is not perfectly comparable to FAO's
  prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity.
