actual_indicator_available: Daily smoking prevalence among the US population aged 18 years and older
actual_indicator_available_description: Percentage of US population aged 18 and over who are daily smokers
us_method_of_computation: >-
  Percentage of persons who are daily smokers is based on responses to two
  questions from the National Health Interview Survey: “Have you smoked at least
  100 cigarettes in your entire life?” and “Do you now smoke cigarettes every
  day, some days, or not at all?” Daily smokers are adults who have smoked 100
  cigarettes in their lifetime and currently smoke every day.  Percentages are
  generated using sampling survey weights to make nationally representative
  population estimates.
