  From ITC, UNCTAD, WTO:

  The indicator is self-explanatory and measures precisely what is required by
  the target.

   From UPU: 
   E-commerce is likely to represent a significant share of international trade transactions by 2030. In order to avoid an e-commerce divide between developing and developed countries, trade policies must fully take into account this irreversible phenomenon. Moreover, international e-commerce will play an essential development role for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in the coming two decades, particularly for those interested in internationalizing their activities.

indicator_name: Developing countries' and least developed countries' share of global exports
target: >-
  Significantly increase the exports of developing countries, in particular with
  a view to doubling the least developed countries' share of global exports by
  2020.
indicator_definition: >-
  From ITC, UNCTAD, WTO:This indicator provides calculations of developing and
  LDCs exports of goods and services toward the rest of the World. The unit of
  measurement could be in % (developing countries' and LDCs share of global
  exports) or alternatively in value (i.e. USD '000). Alternatively, and in
  order to reflect the dual purpose of the target (i.e. increase of developing
  countries exports / doubling the LDCs share for global exports) 2 different
  indicators can be calculated out of the same data, namely: (1) least developed
  countries' share of global exports (in % terms), (2) exports of developing
  countries (in value terms). The indicator will not include export of oil and
  arms. From UPU:  Developing countries and LDCs' e-commerce flows at the export
  level (volumes and/or values, and by product): this indicator would be a
  volume or value index of international e-commerce flows from developing
  countries and LDCs to the rest of the world. International postal and parcel
  flows would be a proxy for international e-commerce flows since the ecommerce
  ecosystem heavily relies on the international postal and express
  infrastructure to transport ecommerce-related shipments.
