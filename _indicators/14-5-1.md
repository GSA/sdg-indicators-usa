  The safeguard of important sites is vital for stemming the decline in
  biodiversity. The establishment of protected areas is an important mechanism
  for achieving this aim, and this indicator serves as a means of measuring
  progress toward the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of marine
  ecosystems and their services, in line with obligations under international
  agreements. Importantly, it is not restricted to any single marine ecosystem
  type, and so faithfully reflects the intent of SDG target 14.2. 

  Levels of access to protected areas vary among the protected area management
  categories. Some areas, such as scientific reserves, are maintained in their
  natural state and closed to any other use. Others are used for recreation or
  tourism, or even open for the sustainable extraction of natural resources. 

  In addition to protecting biodiversity, protected areas have become places of
  high social and economic value: supporting local livelihoods; protecting
  watersheds from erosion; harbouring an untold wealth of genetic resources;
  supporting thriving recreation and tourism industries; providing for science,
  research and education; and forming a basis for cultural and other
  non-material values. 

  This indicator adds meaningful information to, complements and builds from
  traditionally reported simple statistics of territorial area covered by
  protected areas, computed by dividing the total protected area within a
  country by the total territorial area of the country and multiplying by 100.
  Such percentage area coverage statistics do not recognise the extreme
  variation of biodiversity importance over space, and so risk generating
  perverse outcomes through the protection of areas which are large at the
  expense of those which require protection.

indicator_name: Coverage of protected areas in relation to marine areas
target: >-
  By 2020, conserve at least 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, consistent
  with national and international law and based on the best available scientific
  information.
method_of_computation: >-
  The indicator is computed by dividing the total number of KBAs wholly covered
  by protected areas by the total number of KBAs in each country, and
  multiplying by 100. 'Wholly protected' is defined as >98% coverage to allow
  for resolution and digitisation errors in the underlying spatial datasets.
