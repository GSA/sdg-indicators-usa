  The percentage of the population covered by a mobile cellular network can be
  considered as a minimum indicator for ICT access since it provides people with
  the possibility to subscribe to and use mobile-cellular services to
  communicate. Over the last decade, mobile-cellular networks have expanded
  rapidly and helped overcome very basic infrastructure barriers that existed
  when fixed-telephone networks ' often limited to urban and highly populated
  areas - were the dominant telecommunication infrastructure. 

  While 2G (narrowband) mobile-cellular networks offer limited (and mainly
  voice-based) services, higher-speed networks provide increasingly high-speed,
  reliable and high-quality access to the Internet and its increasing amount of
  information, content, services, and applications. Mobile networks are
  therefore essential to overcoming infrastructure barriers, helping people join
  the information society and benefit from the potential of ICTs, in particular
  in least developed countries. 

  The indicator highlights the importance of mobile networks in providing basic,
  as well as advanced communication services and will help design targeted
  policies to overcome remaining infrastructure barriers, and address the
  digital divide. Many governments track this indicator and have set specific
  targets in terms of the mobile population coverage (by technology) that
  operators must achieve.

  Significantly increase access to information and communications technology and
  strive to provide universal and affordable access to the Internet in least
  developed countries by 2020.
indicator_definition: "The indicator percentage of the population covered by a mobile network, broken down by technology, refers to the percentage of inhabitants living within range of a mobile-cellular signal, irrespective of whether or not they are mobile phone subscribers or users. This is calculated by dividing the number of inhabitants within range of a mobile-cellular signal by the total population and multiplying by 100. The indicator is based on where the population lives, and not where they work or go to school, etc. When there are multiple operators offering the service, the maximum population number covered should be reported. Coverage should refer to broadband (3G and more) and narrowband (2G) mobile-cellular technologies and include: \t2G mobile population coverage: Mobile networks with access to data communications (e.g. Internet) at downstream speeds below 256 kbit/s. This includes mobile-cellular technologies such as GPRS, CDMA2000 1x and most EDGE implementations. The indicator refers to the theoretical ability of subscribers to use non-broadband speed mobile data services, rather than the number of active users of such services. \t3G and above mobile-population coverage: Refers to the number of mobile-cellular subscriptions with access to data communications (e.g. the Internet) at broadband downstream speeds (defined here as greater than or equal to 256 kbit/s). The indicator refers to the theoretical ability of subscribers to use broadband speed mobile data services, rather than the number of active users of such services. This includes all high-speed mobile-cellular telephone subscriptions with access to data communications, and includes mobile-cellular technologies such as WCDMA (UMTS) and associated technologies such as HSPA, CDMA2000 1x EV-DO, mobile WiMAX 802.16e and LTE. It excludes low-speed mobilebroadband subscriptions and fixed (wired) Internet subscriptions. As technologies evolve and as more and more countries will deploy and commercialize more advanced mobilebroadband networks (4G, 5G etc.), the indicator will include further breakdowns. ITU collects data for this indicator through an annual questionnaire from national telecommunication regulatory authorities or Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Ministries, who collect the data from licensed mobile-cellular operators. However, they are likely to have different levels and locations of coverage. Another method would be to request each operator's coverage maps, which can be overlaid with maps showing the population of the country."

  The FCC’s annual report, the Mobile Wireless Competition Report, prepared by
  the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, usually includes the most recent
  year's data on 3G+ and 2G+ coverage, either in the body of the report or in
  its associated web appendices and "quick facts."  These two time series were
  created by pulling data from the 6th through 20th annual reports.  Note the
  three different data/computation methods used over this period, as described
  above.  Other notes: (1) 2G+ coverage often appears in the reports simply as
  total mobile coverage, since "2G or faster" captures all digital air
  interfaces, and (1G) analog service is no longer offered. (2) Since the
  measures are 3G or faster and 2G or faster, it is the gap between the two
  figures that gives the coverage of 2G only, or narrowband, service. (3)
  Percentages are shown rounded to one decimal place, as presented in the public
  reports.  (4) "n/a" indicates "not available."
actual_indicator_available_description: >-
  The definitions for the FCC indicators are: (1) percent of population covered
  by 3G or faster service, and (2) percent of population covered by 2G or faster
  service; where "3G" and "2G" have esssentialy the definitions given above. 
  "Coverage" here indicates that at least one operator can provide a signal
  above the required m1nimum, but it is not necessarily true that at least one
  operator is actually offering service at that speed.
