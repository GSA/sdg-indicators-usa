  Number of new HIV infections per 1,000 uninfected population, by sex, age and
  key populations
target: >-
  By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected
  tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other
  communicable diseases.
indicator_definition: >-
  Number of new HIV infections per 1000 person_years among the uninfected
  population. The incidence rate is the number of new cases per population at
  risk in a given time period.
method_of_computation: >-
  Number of people who are newly infected in a specific time period x 1000 /
  Total uninfected person_years of exposure Method of measurement Longitudinal
  data on individuals are the best source of data but are rarely available for
  large populations. Special diagnostic tests in surveys or from health
  facilities can be used to obtain data on HIV incidence. HIV incidence can also
  be modelled using the Spectrum software. Method of estimation Modelling is
  currently used to estimate new infections and incidence. Prevalence data
  inform these models.
