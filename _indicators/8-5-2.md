  Information on unemployment by age illustrates the different dimensions of the
  lack of jobs for people of a given age group. For example, in a country where
  the youth unemployment rate is high and the ratio of the youth unemployment
  rate to the adult unemployment rate is close to one, it may be concluded that
  the problem of unemployment is not specific to youth, but is country-wide. The
  problem of unemployment is unequally distributed when, in addition to a high
  youth unemployment rate, the proportion of youth unemployment in total
  unemployment is high. In this case, employment policies might usefully be
  directed towards easing the entry of young people into the world of work.

indicator_definition: >-
  The unemployment rate is calculated by dividing the total number of unemployed
  (for a country or a specific group of workers) by the corresponding labour
  force, which itself is the sum of the total persons employed and unemployed in
  the group. Persons in unemployment are defined as all those of working age who
  were not in employment, carried out activities to seek employment during a
  specified recent period and were currently available to take up employment
  given a job opportunity.
