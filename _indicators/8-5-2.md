  Information on unemployment by age illustrates the different dimensions of the
  lack of jobs for people of a given age group. For example, in a country where
  the youth unemployment rate is high and the ratio of the youth unemployment
  rate to the adult unemployment rate is close to one, it may be concluded that
  the problem of unemployment is not specific to youth, but is country-wide. The
  problem of unemployment is unequally distributed when, in addition to a high
  youth unemployment rate, the proportion of youth unemployment in total
  unemployment is high. In this case, employment policies might usefully be
  directed towards easing the entry of young people into the world of work.

  By 2030, achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women
  and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and equal
  pay for work of equal value.
indicator_definition: >-
  The unemployment rate is calculated by dividing the total number of unemployed
  (for a country or a specific group of workers) by the corresponding labour
  force, which itself is the sum of the total persons employed and unemployed in
  the group. Persons in unemployment are defined as all those of working age who
  were not in employment, carried out activities to seek employment during a
  specified recent period and were currently available to take up employment
  given a job opportunity.

  The questions noted above were added to the CPS in June 2008 to identify
  persons with a  disability in the civilian noninstitutional population age 16
  and older. The collection of these data is sponsored by the Department of
  Labor's Office of Disability Employment Policy.

  Statistics based on the CPS are subject to both sampling and nonsampling
  error. When a sample, rather than the entire population, is surveyed, there is
  a chance that the sample estimates may differ from the true population values
  they represent. The component of this difference that occurs because samples
  differ by chance is known as sampling error, and its variability is measured
  by the standard error of the estimate. There is about a 90-percent chance, or
  level of confidence, that an estimate based on a sample will differ by no more
  than 1.6 standard errors from the true population value because of sampling
  error. BLS analyses are generally conducted at the 90-percent level of
  confidence.  The CPS data also are affected by nonsampling error. Nonsampling
  error can occur for many reasons, including the failure to sample a segment of
  the population,  inability to obtain information for all respondents in the
  sample, inability or unwillingness of respondents to provide correct
  information, and errors made in the collection or processing of the data. 
  Additional information about the reliability of data from the CPS and
  estimating standard errors is available at
  www.bls.gov/cps/documentation.htm#reliability. 

  CPS estimates are controlled to population totals that are available by age,
  sex, race, and Hispanic ethnicity. These controls are developed by the Census
  Bureau and are based on complete population counts obtained in the decennial
  census. In the years between decennial censuses, they incorporate the latest
  information about population change (births, deaths, and net international
  migration). As part of its annual update of population estimates, the Census
  Bureau introduces adjustments to the total population controls. The updated
  controls typically have a negligible impact on unemployment rates and other
  ratios. The estimates of the population of persons with a disability are not
  controlled to independent population totals of persons with a disability
  because such data are not available. Without independent population totals,
  sample-based estimates are more apt to vary from one time period to the next.
  Information about population controls is available at
