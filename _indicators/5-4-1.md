  The provision of unpaid care and domestic work has a profound implication on
  our understanding of poverty and well-being. As a result of their socially
  ascribed roles, women and girls do the bulk of unpaid care and domestic work,
  which includes household maintenance activities such as cooking and cleaning
  as well as person-toperson care activities such as child and elder care. [2] 

  Producing time use statistics thus contributes to increasing the visibility of
  women's work through better statistics on their contribution to the economy '
  with particular emphasis on the value of goods and services they produce. [1]

  Data are from the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), which is nationally
  representative of the U.S. civilian noninstitutional population age 15 and
  over. Individuals are selected from households that have completed the 8th
  month of the Current Population Survey. Each selected individual is
  interviewed one time, by telephone, about how they spent their time on one
  day. Individuals have been interviewed for the ATUS on nearly every day since
  the survey began in 2003. For information about ATUS methods, see the BLS
  Handbook of Methods:  https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/atus/home.htm. Data are
  estimates of average hours per day (see formula in section 7.4 of the ATUS
  User's Guide:  https://www.bls.gov/tus/atususersguide.pdf).
