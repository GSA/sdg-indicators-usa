  From ILO: 
   The industry sector, which is largely composed of manufacturing, is central to the economy given its significant contribution to national product and employment. It impacts also other aspects of life such as health and the environment. The industry sector being a major source of job creation (directly and indirectly), the study of trends and patterns of the share and growth of employment in industry can reveal valuable information on the labour market configuration and the situation in terms of social cohesion. 

   From UNIDO: 
   This indicator represents the contribution of manufacturing in job creation. It is universally important indicator. For industrialized countries it represents sustained growth, for developing countries it shows the ability of manufacturing to absorb surplus labour from traditional sectors. Compared to the indicator 9.2.1 it measures the labour productivity ' another key indicator for measuring technological progress.

indicator_name: Manufacturing employment as a proportion of total employment
target: >-
  Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030,
  significantly raise industry's share of employment and gross domestic product,
  in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed
  countries.
indicator_definition: >-
  From ILO:  This indicator is computed as the number of persons employed in the
  industry sector divided by total employment. Employed persons are defined as
  all those of working age who, during a short reference period, were engaged in
  any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit. The
  industry sector comprises mining and quarrying, manufacturing, construction
  and public utilities (electricity, gas and water).  From UNIDO:  Employment is
  defined as a work performed for pay or profit. The value is obtained by
  summing up the number of employed in all manufacturing activities. The
  manufacturing employment indicator is presented in absolute terms as well as
  relative to total employment.

  Manufacturingâ€™s share of total employment is calculated by dividing the
  employment estimate for manufacturing  by the estimate for total employment.

  Labor input measures are published by the BLS Office of Productivity and
  Technology (OPT) and are based primarily on data from the Current Employment
  Statistics (CES) Survey that are supplemented by data from the Current
  Population Survey (CPS) from the BLS Office of Employment and Unemployment
  Statistics (OEUS).  The measures published by OPT include all persons working
  in each sector - wage and salary workers, the self-employed, and unpaid family
  workers.
