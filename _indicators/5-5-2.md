  Women participate in politics and decision-making at all levels, in different
  functions and across all spheres. They participate as candidates for local,
  regional and national elections, members of parliament or local council, heads
  of state and government, ministers, members of political parties, leaders and
  managers of business. Capturing an accurate assessment of women's
  representation across these different forms of political and economic
  leadership is a key marker of progress in achieving gender equality and
  women's empowerment.
