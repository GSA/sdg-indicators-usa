  Rationale 

  Target 8.9 has several dimensions but the essence of the target seems to be on
  promoting sustainable tourism [that ...]. It is recognized that the suggested
  indicator does not cater to all dimensions of the target, but finding one
  indicator that would do so seems unviable, certainly over the short-medium
  term. 

  There is the added challenge that the concept "sustainable tourism" is mainly
  a policy construct and not defined nor part of an established or
  internationally conceptual/statistical framework at this point. Even though
  UNWTO together with a number of countries, UNSD and OECD, and counting on the
  support of the UNCEEA are putting put in motion an initiative towards
  developing the measurement of the relationship between tourism and
  sustainability, notably through linking SEEA and TSA, it seems that the
  production of internationally comparable data on (something that could
  approximate for) "sustainable tourism" in a significant number of countries
  still has some years to go. 

  For the meantime, the suggested indicator (in its two parts, on tourism
  related GDP and jobs) seems to be a sensible approximation because (a) it is a
  good conceptual fit to some key dimensions of the target (b) it stems from a
  systems approach and is based on sound internationally agreed methodology, and
  (c) there is a significant number of countries already producing data for this
  indicator. In addition, the suggested indicator (tourism related GDP and jobs)
  is in line with Goal 8's general focus on economic growth and employment. 

  Finally, the TDGDP/GDP part of this indicator can complement Target 14.7's
  indicator: "Fisheries as a % of GDP" in order to cater to tourism dimension of
  this target. 

   Interpretation 
   Target 8.9 has several dimensions; this caters to the dimension: tourism; promote [...] tourism. The value of the economic contribution of tourism captured by this indicator, and (relative) increases or decreases in it, could indicate the degree to which tourism is being successfully promoted. This indicator is useful for policy on tourism at national level and the level of sub-national regions as it gives the only credible measure of the economic contribution of tourism, which can be compared to GDP contributions of other economic activities. The indicator has been found especially useful in promoting and mainstreaming tourism in policy agendas at all levels. The indicator can also be compared across countries, although true international comparability of the figures needs to be improved.

indicator_name: Tourism direct GDP as a proportion of total GDP and in growth rate
target: >-
  By 2030, devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism that
  creates jobs and promotes local culture and products.
indicator_definition: >-
  Tourism Direct GDP (TDGDP) is defined as the sum of the part of gross value
  added (at basic prices) generated by all industries in response to internal
  tourism consumption plus the amount of net taxes on products and imports
  included within the value of this expenditure at purchasers' prices (TSA: RMF
  2008 para. 4.96). Presenting this economic contribution of tourism as a share
  of GDP shows the relative size of the tourism sector in the economy.

  All statistics are reported for the total tourism for the U.S., as well as
  broken out by four major commodity groups ( Traveler accommodations,
  Transportation, Food and beverage services, and Recreation, entertainment and
  shopping), and four minor subcategories. Transportation is divided into two
  subcategories; Passenger air and All other transportation-related
  commodities,  while Recreation, entertainment and shopping is divided into;
  Recreation and entertainment, and Shopping.
