  The indicator signifies overall respect for the principle that persons
  awaiting trial shall not be detained in custody. This, in turn, is premised on
  aspects of the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. From a
  development perspective, extensive use of pre-sentence detention when not
  necessary for reasons such as the prevention of absconding, the protection of
  victims or witnesses, or the prevention of the commission of further offences,
  can divert criminal justice system resources, and exert financial and
  unemployment burdens on the accused and his or her family. Measuring the
  relative extent to which pre-sentence detention is used can provide the
  evidence to assist countries in lowering such burdens and ensuring its
  proportionate use.

indicator_name: Unsentenced detainees as proportion of overall prison population
target: >-
  Promote the rule of law at the national and international levels and ensure
  equal access to justice for all.
indicator_definition: >-
  The total number of persons held in detention who have not yet been sentenced,
  as a percentage of the total number of persons held in detention, on a
  specified date. 'Sentenced' refers to persons subject to criminal proceedings
  who have received a decision from a competent authority regarding their
  conviction or acquittal. For the purposes of the indicator, persons who have
  received a 'non-final' decision (such as where a conviction is subject to
  appeal) are considered to be 'sentenced'.

  Bureau of Justice Statistics/ National Prisoners Statistics and Annual Survey
  of Jails
comments_and_limitations: "National Prisoners Statistics (NPS) - Started in 1926 under a mandate from Congress, NPS collects annual data on prisoners at yearend. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) sponsors the survey, and the U.S. Census Bureau serves as the data collection agent. The NPS distinguishes between inmates in custody and prisoners under jurisdiction. To have custody of a prisoner, a state or the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) must hold that inmate in one of its facilities. To have jurisdiction over a prisoner, the state or BOP must have legal authority over that prisoner, regardless of where the prisoner is incarcerated or supervised. The NPS jurisdiction counts include persons held in prisons, penitentiaries, correctional facilities, halfway houses, boot camps, farms, training or treatment centers, and hospitals. Counts also include prisoners who were temporarily absent (less than 30 days), in court, or on work release; housed in privately operated facilities, local jails, or other state or federal facilities; and serving concurrent sentences for more than one correctional authority. The NPS custody counts include all inmates held within a respondent’s facilities, including inmates housed for other correctional facilities. The custody counts exclude inmates held in local jails and in other jurisdictions. With a few exceptions, the NPS custody counts exclude inmates held in privately operated facilities. Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ) - In years between a complete census of local jails, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) conducts the Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ). ASJ uses a stratified probability sample of jail jurisdictions to estimate the number and characteristics of local inmates nationwide. In the sampling design, the jail jurisdictions nationwide are grouped into 10 strata. In 2016, the 10 strata were defined by two variables: the jail jurisdiction average daily population (ADP), and whether the jurisdiction held at least one juvenile. For 8 of the 10 strata, a random sample of jail jurisdictions was selected. For the remaining two strata, all jurisdictions were included in the sample. One stratum consisted of all jails that were operated jointly by two or more jurisdictions (referred to as multi-jurisdictional jails). The other stratum (referred to as certainty stratum) consisted of all jail jurisdictions that held juvenile inmates at the time of the 2013 Census of Jail Inmates and had an ADP of 500 or more inmates during the 12 months ending December 31, 2013; or held only adult inmates and had an ADP of 750 or more; or were located in California; or were known to be operating in 2015 but were not included n the 2013 Census of Jails. BJS obtains data from sampled jail jurisdictions by mailed and web-based survey questionnaires. After follow-up phone calls, the item response rate for jails that responded to the 2016 survey was nearly 97%. BJS implements nonresponse weight adjustment procedures to account for unit nonresponse and a weighted sequential hot-deck/cold-deck imputation procedure for critical items. See BJS website for questionnaires and additional metadata: https://www.bjs.gov/. Note: (1)\tAnnual jail inmate estimates are subject to sampling error. The standard error for the percentage unconvicted was 0.45% in 2016. (2)\tEstimates for 2000-2014 were based on mid-year jail populations (typically June 30). Estimates for 2015-2016 were based on year-end prison populations (December 31). (3)\tUnsentenced state and federal prisoner counts exclude an unknown number held in privately operated facilities."
