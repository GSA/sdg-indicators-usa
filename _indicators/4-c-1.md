  From UNESCO: 
   Teachers play a key role in ensuring the quality of education provided. Ideally all teachers should receive adequate, appropriate and relevant pedagogical training to teach at the chosen level of education and be academically well-qualified in the subject(s) they are expected to teach. This indicator measures the share of the teaching work force which is pedagogically well-trained. 
  From OECD: 

  To provide policy-relevant analysis on teachers' participation in professional
  development activities through a robust indicator.

The indicator should be calculated separately for public and private institutions. From OECD: Teachers (ISCED 2 level) were asked to indicate whether they had participated in any of the following activities 12 months prior to the survey: \tCourses/workshops (on subject matter or methods and/or other education-related topics). \tEducation conferences or seminars (where teachers and/or researchers present their research results and discuss education problems). \tObservation visits to other schools. \tObservation visits to business premises, public organisations, or non-governmental organisations. \tIn-service training courses in business premises, public organisations or non-governmental organisations. \tQualification programmes (e.g. a degree programme). \tParticipation in a network of teachers formed specifically for the professional development of teachers. \tIndividual or collaborative research on a topic of professional interest. \tMentoring and/or peer observation and coaching as part of a formal school arrangement"

actual_indicator_available_description: "The Schools and Staffing Survey (SASS) was conducted by NCES seven times between 1987 through 2011. SASS was an integrated study public and private school districts, schools, principals, and teachers designed to provide descriptive data on the context of elementary and secondary education. SASS covered a wide range of topics from teacher demand, teacher and principal characteristics, general conditions in schools, principals' and teachers' perceptions of school climate and problems in their schools, teacher compensation, district hiring and retention practices, to basic characteristics of the student population. After 2011–12, NCES redesigned SASS and named it the National Teacher and Principal Survey (NTPS) to reflect the redesigned study's focus on the teacher and principal labor market and on the state of K-12 school staff. NCES first conducted NTPS in 2015–16 and released data in 2017.
