  From UNESCO: 
   Teachers play a key role in ensuring the quality of education provided. Ideally all teachers should receive adequate, appropriate and relevant pedagogical training to teach at the chosen level of education and be academically well-qualified in the subject(s) they are expected to teach. This indicator measures the share of the teaching work force which is pedagogically well-trained. 

  From OECD: 

  To provide policy-relevant analysis on teachers' participation in professional
  development activities through a robust indicator.
