rationale_interpretation: >-
  Economic growth in a country can be ascribed either to increased employment or
  to more production on average by those who are employed. The latter effect can
  be described through statistics on labour productivity and thereby it is a key
  measure of economic and labour market performance.

comments_and_limitations: >-
  Business sector output is based on GDP, but includes only a subset of the
  goods and services included in GDP. The business sector comprises about 75
  percent of GDP since it must exclude those portions of the economy for which
  productivity measures cannot be constructed. General government, the output of
  the employees of nonprofit institutions and private households, and the rental
  value of owner-occupied real estate are excluded.
actual_indicator_available_description: >-
  The measure describes the relationship between real output and one measure of
  labor input involved in its production. Measures of growth in output per job
  show the changes from period to period in the amount of goods and services
  produced per job. They reflect the joint effects of many influences, including
  changes in technology; capital investment; level of output; utilization of
  capacity, energy, and materials; the organization of production; managerial
  skill; and the characteristics and effort of the work force.
us_method_of_computation: >-
  Output per job is calculated by dividing an index of real output by an index
  of the number of jobs of all persons, including employees, proprietors, and
  unpaid family workers.
