  Rationale 

  Target 8.9 has several dimensions but the essence of the target seems to be on
  promoting sustainable tourism [that ...]. It is recognized that the suggested
  indicator does not cater to all dimensions of the target, but finding one
  indicator that would do so seems unviable, certainly over the short-medium
  term. 

  There is the added challenge that the concept "sustainable tourism" is mainly
  a policy construct and not defined nor part of an established or
  internationally conceptual/statistical framework at this point. Even though
  UNWTO together with a number of countries, UNSD and OECD, and counting on the
  support of the UNCEEA are putting put in motion an initiative towards
  developing the measurement of the relationship between tourism and
  sustainability, notably through linking SEEA and TSA, it seems that the
  production of internationally comparable data on (something that could
  approximate for) "sustainable tourism" in a significant number of countries
  still has some years to go. 

  For the meantime, the suggested indicator (in its two parts, on tourism
  related GDP and jobs) seems to be a sensible approximation because (a) it is a
  good conceptual fit to some key dimensions of the target (b) it stems from a
  systems approach and is based on sound internationally agreed methodology, and
  (c) there is a significant number of countries already producing data for this
  indicator. In addition, the suggested indicator (tourism related GDP and jobs)
  is in line with Goal 8's general focus on economic growth and employment. 

  Finally, the TDGDP/GDP part of this indicator can complement Target 14.7's
  indicator: "Fisheries as a % of GDP" in order to cater to tourism dimension of
  this target. 

   Interpretation 
   Target 8.9 has several dimensions; this caters to the dimension: tourism that creates jobs. It could also give an indication on how successful the "promotion" of tourism as job creator is being: promote [...] tourism that creates jobs.

  By 2030, devise and implement policies to promote sustainable tourism that
  creates jobs and promotes local culture and products.

  The "tourism industries", or tourism characteristic industries, comprise all
  establishments for which the principal activity is a tourism characteristic
  activity, i.e. the activities that typically produce tourism characteristic
  products (IRTS 2008 paras. 5.10-5.11). For international comparability
  purposes these are (according to ISIC Rev. 4 categories): accommodation for
  visitors (5510, 5520, 5590, 6810 and 6820), food and beverage serving
  activities (5610, 5629 and 5630), railway passenger transport (4911), road
  passenger transport (4922), water passenger transport (5011 and 5021), air
  passenger transport (5110), transport equipment rental (7710), travel agencies
  and other reservation service activities (7911, 7912 and 7990), cultural
  activities (9000, 9102, 9103), and sport and recreational activities (7721,
  9200, 9311, 9319, 9321 and 9329). Regarding jobs, the agreement between an
  employee and the employer defines a job and each self-employed person has a
  job. The number of jobs in the economy thus exceeds the number of persons
  employed to the extent that some employees have more than one job (SNA 2008
  para. 19.30 in IRTS 2008 Compilation Guide para. 7.6). Consequently, the
  number of jobs (demand side) and the number of persons employed (supply side)
  are dissimilar categories and therefore usually do not match. In this respect,
  it should be noted that employment in the tourism industries refers to all the
  jobs (in all occupations) in both tourism-characteristic activities and
  non-tourism-characteristic activities in all establishments in tourism
  industries19. The indicator shows the relative importance of jobs in the
  tourism industries as a share of the economy's total jobs.

  Tourism employment. Total tourism-related employment consists of direct
  tourism employment plus indirect tourism employment. Direct tourism employment
  comprises all jobs where the workers are engaged in the production of direct
  tourism output (for example, hotel staff and airline pilots), and indirect
  tourism employment comprises all jobs where the workers are engaged in the
  production of indirect tourism output (for example, workers producing hotel
  toiletries and delivering fuel to airlines).
