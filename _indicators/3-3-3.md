  By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected
  tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other
  communicable diseases.
indicator_definition: Number of malaria cases per 1000 persons per year.
method_of_computation: >-
  Number of malaria cases / Population at risk (number of people living in areas
  where malaria transmission occurs) Method of measurement Complete data on
  malaria cases reported through surveillance systems are the best source of
  data but are rarely available for large populations. Reported data on malaria
  cases generally need to be corrected for extent of health service use,
  incompleteness of reporting and lack of case confirmation. In high
  transmission areas with limited health service data but with good data on
  parasite prevalence the number of cases can be estimated from parasite
  prevalence.''The denominator is estimated, using risk mapping and population
  data. Method of estimation WHO compiles data on reported confirmed cases of
  malaria, submitted by national malaria control programmes and estimates the
  extent of underreporting.''Where necessary the number of cases are inferred
  from parasite prevalence surveys.''

  Are there statistically-significant cases of malaria (unrelated to travel) in
  the US?
