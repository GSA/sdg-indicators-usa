  With the strong development of national and international e-commerce, the
  quality of the postal and parcels delivery services is becoming a major
  concern for millions of enterprises and consumers transacting online. It is
  sometimes considered as a major hurdle by these market players and one of the
  challenges for trade facilitation, particularly for micro, small and
  medium-size enterprises interested in internationalizing their activities.

target: >-
  Develop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, including
  regional and transborder infrastructure, to support economic development and
  human well-being, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all.
indicator_definition:
  'Average parcel shipping time/parcel shipping time standards, by country, both for domestic and international parcel services, and by product': >-
    this is the level of reliability of domestic or international parcel
    delivery services and for different products exchanged between countries.
    This ratio is determined after dividing the average parcel shipping time by
    the standard shipping time expected for parcels delivery at the national or
    international level, and at the product level depending on data
    availability. An alternative way of computing a similar quality of service
    ratio would be to use the percentage of parcels actually delivered within
    the quality standard, i.e. within the standard for shipping times. The
    standard for shipping time is the expected end-to-end transit time and is
    often expressed as the posting day + one, two , three, four or five days
    depending on the country geography and distance between countries.
