  Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 calls for local
  governments to adopt and implement local DRR strategies with their own
  targets, indicators and timeframes. 

  Global population is now half urban and expected to be nearly 70% urban by
  2050. Increasing resilience of cities is critical to reduce disaster risk and
  achieve sustainable development. Cities are also very vulnerable to natural
  disasters, especially climate-related shocks. Over half of all coastal areas
  are urbanized and 21 of the world's 33 megacities lie in coastal flood zones.
  Coastal cities are particularly affected by sea level rise, coastal flooding
  and erosion, and extreme events (e.g. tsunamis and storm surges) due to the
  undermining natural protective barriers, low levels of development combined
  with rapid population growth in low lying coastal areas and inadequate
  capacity to adapt. In addition to the impact on communities and non-human
  species, the unplanned urbanization also undermines the ecosystem services
  that support much hard urban infrastructure. This type of development also
  exacerbates urban vulnerability to climate change impacts, including
  hydro-meteorological and geological hazards. 

  Located mostly in cities where disadvantaged groups are situated and when
  affordable access is addressed, resilient infrastructures such as health,
  education, road and other critical infrastructures will have direct impact on
  reducing inequality and making growth more inclusive and sustainable. 

  The opportunity is that 60% of the area expected to be urban by 2030 remains
  to be built, indicating that the shape of future cities can be proactively
  guided into more risk-sensitive development. An increasing number of cities
  that adopt and implement local DRR strategies will contribute to sustainable
  development from economic, environmental and social perspectives. 

  The indicator will build bridge between the SDGs and the Sendai Framework for
  DRR because the adoption of local DRR strategies is one of Sendai Framework
  global targets and will be also monitored under the Sendai Framework
  Monitoring System.

target: >-
  By 2020, substantially increase the number of cities and human settlements
  adopting and implementing integrated policies and plans towards inclusion,
  resource efficiency, mitigation and adaptation to climate change, resilience
  to disasters, and develop and implement, in line with the Sendai Framework for
  Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, holistic disaster risk management at all
  levels.
indicator_definition: "Local DRR Strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030: local disaster risk reduction strategies and plans, across different timescales with targets, indicators and time frames, aimed at preventing the creation of risk, the reduction of existing risk and the strengthening of economic, social, health and environmental resilience (Sendai Framework, para27 (b)). Note: the DRR strategies need to be based on risk information and assessments. Local Government: Form of public administration at the lowest tier of administration within a given state, which generally acts within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. \tNote: Terminology will be discussed and finalized in the Open-ended Intergovernmental Working Group for Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction."
