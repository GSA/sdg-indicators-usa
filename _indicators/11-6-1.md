  Recycling and reusing solid waste is a way to reduce the amount of waste to be
  disposed in landfills. A prosper city seeks to recycle the most part of its
  solid waste to increase the lifespan of its landfills and to profit solid
  waste as much as possible.

  Proportion of urban solid waste regularly collected and with adequate final
  discharge out of total urban solid waste generated, by cities
target: >-
  By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities,
  including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other
  waste management.
indicator_definition: >-
  The recycling rate is the tonnage recycled from municipal waste divided by the
  total municipal waste arising. Recycling includes material recycling,
  composting and anaerobic digestion. Municipal waste consists to a large extent
  of waste generated by households, but may also include similar wastes
  generated by small businesses and public institutions and collected by the
  municipality; this latter part of municipal waste may vary from municipality
  to municipality and from country to country, depending on the local waste
  management system (Eurostat, 2013)
